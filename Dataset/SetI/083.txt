<name>Thompson</name> says <name>Gerrard</name> should stay

Liverpool legend <name>Phil Thompson</name> has pleaded with <name>Steve Gerrard</name> to reject any overtures from Chelsea.

The ex-Reds assistant boss also warned that any honours won at Chelsea would be cheapened by the bid to buy success. He told BBC Radio Five Live: "Liverpool would think about any bid made but it will all be down to <name>Steve</name> in the end. "But it wouldn't have that same sweet feeling at Chelsea, where it's all money-orientated and about simply buying the best." <name>Thompson</name> reacted sharply to some Liverpool supporters, who criticised <name>Gerrard's</name> performance in the Carling Cup final against Chelsea. A number of fans questioned <name>Gerrard's</name> commitment and sarcastically branded his own goal in Liverpool's 3-2 defeat as his first goal for Chelsea.

<name>Thompson</name> added: "I heard those comments from so-called supporters and they were diabolical, absolutely outrageous. "<name>Stevie</name> carried the club last year and this year. He's always put Liverpool first." <name>Thompson</name>, who savoured seven title-winning seasons and two European Cup triumphs during his Anfield playing career, is confident that the lure of Champions League football will keep <name>Gerrard</name> at Anfield. "I hope Champions League football will beckon for Liverpool - either as winners or as finishing fourth in the Premiership - and he will commit himself. "There has been a lot of soul-searching the way things have gone lately. "I hope he's hardening to the fact he will have big decisions to make but I hope it is to the benefit of <name>Steven Gerrard</name> and I hope it is worthwhile for Liverpool."
