<name>Langer</name> century deflates Pakistan

First Test, Perth, day one (stumps): Australia 357-8 v Pakistan

The local opener steered Australia to 357-8 with 181 not out, a 264-ball knock which included 17 boundaries and three sixes. <name>Langer</name> put on 152 runs for the sixth wicket with <name>Adam Gilchrist</name> (69) after the hosts had slumped to 78-5. <name>Shoaib Akhtar</name> revelled on the pacy pitch to return figures of 4-89. <name>Shoaib</name> and fellow paceman <name>Mohammad Sami</name> (2-94) held sway early on after Pakistan won the toss and inserted Australia. But <name>Langer</name> stood firm throughout the day to wrest back the initiative, displaying rare flair in his 21st Test century and fourth against Pakistan. When he reached 41, <name>Langer</name> passed West Indies skipper <name>Brian Lara</name> (1,178 runs) to become the leading Test run-scorer in 2004. Should he remain unbeaten when Australia's innings finishes on Friday, he will become the 42nd batsman in Test history to carry his bat.

<name>Shoaib</name> claimed an early victim by trapping <name>Matthew Hayden</name> lbw for four with a rapid, overpitched inswinger. Skipper <name>Ricky Ponting</name> and <name>Langer</name> then put on 50 before Ponting fell to <name>Sami</name>, bowled through the gate playing an expansive off-drive. <name>Sami</name> struck again in his next over to have <name>Damien Martyn</name> caught behind, and when <name>Shoaib</name> removed <name>Darren Lehmann</name> (bowled) and <name>Michael Clarke</name> (caught) cheaply Australia were reeling on 78-5. But <name>Langer</name> found an able ally in vice captain <name>Gilchrist</name>, who took the long handle to the hosts' predicament. Gilchrist struck 10 boundaries in his 78-ball stay, helping Australia along to 230 before his stumps were levelled by all-rounder <name>Abdul Razzaq</name>. <name>Razzaq</name> soon accounted for <name>Shane Warne</name> (caught), bringing <name>Jason Gillespie</name> to the crease in what marked the start of another deflating period for Pakistan.

<name>Gillespie</name> (24 off 69 balls) and <name>Langer</name> put on 80 runs, with <name>Langer</name> finding the middle of the bat on several occasions to punish Pakistan. His brutal on-driven six off Sami late in the day was his best shot, and even <name>Gillespie's</name> departure to <name>Shoaib</name> just before stumps could not raise Pakistan's spirits. <name>Langer's</name> partner at the resumption of play on day two will be <name>Mike Kasprowicz</name>, who was preferred yet again to fast bowler <name>Brett Lee</name>.
