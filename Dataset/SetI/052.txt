Australia return to winning ways

Second one-day international, Sydney: Australia 261-7 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 244 (47.1 overs) by 17 runs

<name>Adam Gilchrist</name> (60) and <name>Darren Lehmann</name> (52) played the leading roles as the home side totalled 261-7. New Zealand crumbled to 86-6 in reply but <name>Chris Cairns</name> hit 50 off 40 balls and <name>Kyle Mills</name> and <name>Daniel Vettori</name> put on 70 to keep their side in the hunt. But they were eventually all out for 244 and the three-match series will now be decided in Brisbane on Friday. The game came to an end at the start of the 48th over when <name>Chris Harris</name>, who bravely came out to bat in his 250th one-day game despite a shoulder injury, was bowled by a yorker from <name>Glenn McGrath</name>. <name>Mills</name> was left high and dry on 44 not out after a magnificent 26-ball innings, featuring four big sixes. There were plenty of anxious faces among the Australian fans during his ninth wicket stand with <name>Vettori</name> (33), who was finally run out by <name>Ricky Ponting's</name> underarm throw. Home skipper <name>Ponting</name> had earlier chosen to bat after winning the toss and was rewarded as <name>Adam Gilchrist</name> took the attack to the New Zealand seamers. He struck a six and eight fours to reach his half century off only 37 deliveries, before perishing for 60 in cavalier fashion as a pull shot off <name>Scott Styris</name> was caught by <name>Nathan Astle</name> at deep square leg.

<name>Ponting</name> maintained the tempo with a quickfire 32 but his exit, caught at mid-off from the bowling of <name>Mills</name>, sparked a slump which saw Australia decline from 140-2 to 161-6. <name>Matthew Hayden</name> (43) was run out by <name>Mathew Sinclair</name>, <name>Damien Martyn</name> was lbw to <name>Mills</name> for five and <name>Andrew Symonds</name> faced only two balls before he was trapped in front by <name>Vettori</name>. <name>Michael Clarke</name> was next to go for six when he edged a ball from <name>Chris Cairns</name> to keeper <name>Brendon McCullum</name>. But <name>Darren Lehmann</name> and <name>Brad Hogg</name> prevented the innings from going into freefall, adding 74 in 17 overs for the seventh wicket. <name>Lehmann</name> was run out, leaving <name>Hogg</name> (41 not out) and <name>Brett Lee</name> (10 not out) to see the total past 250 to leave the Kiwis facing a tough target.

They made a poor start as <name>Astle</name> was caught behind off <name>Brett Lee</name> for 11 and <name>Sinclair</name> fell victim to <name>Jason Gillespie</name> for 17, with <name>Matthew Hayden</name> taking the catch. Captain <name>Stephen Fleming</name> fell lbw for 34 to left-arm spinner <name>Hogg</name>, who proved the most successful Australian bowler with figures of 3-45. The middle order followed in quick succession and it looked like the home side would wrap things up in double quick time. <name>Cairns</name> counter attacked with two sixes and four fours before <name>Gillespie</name> brought his innings to an end, leaving <name>Mills</name> and <name>Vettori</name> to try and secure an unlikely victory. The required rate came down to a run per ball thanks to <name>Mills'</name> big-hitting exploits, but <name>Harris</name> was greeted by a short-pitched ball aimed at his chest and a ferocious full toss from <name>Lee</name> after <name>Vettori</name> had been dismissed. The veteran, whose suffered a torn rotator cuff while fielding earlier in the game, collected four singles but his gallantry was in vain as <name>McGrath</name> produced the perfect delivery to bring the game to an end.
