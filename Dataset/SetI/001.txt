Man Utd stroll to Cup win

<name>Wayne Rooney</name> made a winning return to Everton as Manchester United cruised into the FA Cup quarter-finals.

<name>Rooney</name> received a hostile reception, but goals in each half from <name>Quinton Fortune</name> and <name>Cristiano Ronaldo</name> silenced the jeers at Goodison Park. <name>Fortune</name> headed home after 23 minutes before <name>Ronaldo</name> scored when <name>Nigel Martyn</name> parried <name>Paul Scholes'</name> free-kick. <name>Marcus Bent</name> missed Everton's best chance when <name>Roy Carroll</name>, who was later struck by a missile, saved at his feet.

<name>Rooney's</name> return was always going to be a potential flashpoint, and he was involved in an angry exchange with a spectator even before kick-off. And <name>Rooney's</name> every touch was met with a deafening chorus of jeers from the crowd that once idolised the 19-year-old. Everton started brightly and <name>Fortune</name> needed to be alert to scramble away a header from <name>Bent</name> near the goal-line. But that was the cue for United to take complete control with a supreme passing display on a Goodison Park pitch that was cutting up. <name>Fortune</name> gave United the lead after 23 minutes, rising to meet <name>Ronaldo's</name> cross from eight yards after the Portuguese youngster had been allowed too much time and space by the hapless <name>Gary Naysmith</name>. United dominated without creating too many clear-cut chances, and they almost paid the price for not making the most of their domination two minutes before half-time. <name>Mikel Arteta</name> played a superb ball into the area but <name>Bent</name>, played onside by <name>Gabriel Heintze</name>, hesitated and <name>Carroll</name> plunged at his fee to save. United almost doubled their lead after 48 minutes when <name>Ronaldo's</name> low drive from 25 yards took a deflection off <name>Tony Hibbert</name>, but <name>Martyn</name> dived to save brilliantly. And <name>Martyn</name> came to Everton's rescue three minutes later when <name>Rooney's</name> big moment almost arrived as he raced clean through, but once again the veteran keeper was in outstanding form. But there was nothing <name>Martyn</name> could do when United doubled their lead after 57 minutes as they doubled their advantage. <name>Scholes'</name> free-kick took a deflection, and <name>Martyn</name> could only parry the ball out for <name>Ronaldo</name>, who reacted first to score easily. Everton's problems worsened when <name>James McFadden</name> limped off with an injury. And there may be further trouble ahead for Everton after goalkeeper <name>Carroll</name> required treatment after he was struck on the head by a missile thrown from behind the goal. <name>Rooney's</name> desperate search for a goal on his return to Everton was halted again by <name>Martyn</name> in injury-time when he outpaced Stubbs, but once again <name>Martyn</name> denied the England striker.

- Manchester United coach <name>Sir Alex Ferguson</name>: "It was a fantastic performance by us. In fairness I think Everton have missed a couple of players and got some young players out. "The boy <name>Ronaldo</name> is a fantastic player. He's persistent and never gives in. "I don't know how many fouls he had He gets up and wants the ball again, he's truly a fabulous player."
