<name>Cudicini</name> misses Carling Cup final

Chelsea goalkeeper <name>Carlo Cudicini</name> will miss Sunday's Carling Cup final after the club dropped their appeal against his red card against Newcastle.

The Italian was sent off for bringing down <name>Shola Ameobi</name> in the final minute of Sunday's match. Blues boss <name>Jose Mourinho</name> had promised to pick <name>Cudicini</name> for the final instead of first-choice keeper <name>Petr Cech</name>. The 31-year-old will now serve a one-match suspension commencing with immediate effect.

<name>Cudicini</name> kept a club record 24 clean sheets last season for Chelsea, but <name>Petr Cech</name> has established himself as first choice for <name>Mourinho</name> since moving to Stamford Bridge in summer 2004. The 22-year-old Czech Republic international has set a new Premiership record of 961 consecutive minutes without conceding a goal, a mark which is still running. But <name>Mourinho</name> has used Cudicini regularly in the Carling Cup, and the Italian has only let in one goal in his four appearances during Chelsea's run to the final.
