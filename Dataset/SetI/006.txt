<name>Mido</name> makes third apology

<name>Ahmed 'Mido' Hossam</name> has made another apology to the Egyptian people in an attempt to rejoin the national team.

The 21-year-old told a news conference in Cairo on Sunday that he is sorry for the problems that have led to his exclusion from the Pharaohs since July last year. <name>Mido</name> said: "There isn't much I have to say today, all there is to say is that I came specially from England to Egypt to rejoin the national team and to apologise for all my mistakes." <name>Mido</name> was axed by former coach <name>Marco Tardelli</name> after failing to answer a national call-up, claiming he had a groin injury. But he then played in a friendly for his club AS Roma within 24 hours of a World Cup qualifying match at home to Cameroon last September. <name>Mido</name> added: "It's not my right to give orders and say when I want to play ... at the same time I will always make sure that I put the national's team's matches as my top priority. "I feel that the national players are playing with a new spirit as I saw them play against Belgium (Egypt won 4-0 on Wednesday) and I simply want to add to their success. "I do confess that I was rude to the Egyptian press at times but now I have gained more experience and know that I will never go anywhere without the press's support. "Many of the international stars like <name>David Beckham</name> and (<name>Zinedine</name>) <name>Zidane</name> had the press opposing them. "So I'm now used to the fact that the press can be against me at times and I don't have to overreact when this happens. Meanwhile, Egypt FA spokesman <name>Methat Shalaby</name> welcomed the apology and said no one had exerted pressure on <name>Mido</name> to apologise. "Mido's apology today does not negatively affect <name>Mido</name> in anyway, on the contrary it makes him a bigger star and a role model for all football players," <name>Shalaby</name> said. <name>Shalaby</name> earlier said that after an apology <name>Mido</name> would be available for the national side if coach <name>Hassan Shehata</name> chose him. <name>Mido</name> joined Tottenham in an 18-month loan deal near the end of the January transfer window, scoring twice on his debut against Portsmouth.
