World XI win Tsunami match

Tsunami Appeal match, Melbourne: ICC World XI 344-8 beat Asian 232 XI by 111 runs

<name>Ricky Ponting</name> hit 115 in a massive total of 344-8 after electing to bat first in front of a crowd of 70,101. <name>Rahul Dravid</name> top-scored with 75 not out in the Asian XI reply, after <name>Virender Sehwag's</name> brisk 45. <name>Daniel Vettori</name> took 3-58 while England's <name>Darren Gough</name> took a wicket and a catch. <name>Shane Warne</name> had 2-27. The game, broadcast in 122 countries to an estimated global television audience of one billion, began with a minute's silence for the victims of the tsunami.

Australian Prime Minister <name>John Howard</name> tossed a coin to start the match. And afterwards the International Cricket Council chief executive, <name>Malcolm Speed</name>, paid tribute to the players for taking part. He said: "This signifies the game's compassion and commitment to provide as a much help as possible to enable the survivors of the Tsunami to rebuild their lives so far as this is possible." <name>Ponting</name> entertained the fans early on by hitting some big shots off <name>Anil Kumble</name> and <name>Abdul Razzaq</name> and the World XI's run rate was soon ticking along at a healthy rate. <name>Chris Cairns</name> (69) and <name>Brian Lara</name> (52) enjoyed themselves as a middle order packed with stars delivered the goods.

And there was plenty of time for the unorthodox - Australia tailender <name>Glenn McGrath</name> batted at number six, where he fell for a golden duck. <name>Muttiah Muralitharan</name> captured his wicket in overall figures of 3-59. It was a welcome comeback performance from the Sri Lankan who had been out injured for five months and who was almost caught up in the 26 December tragedy. <name>Sehwag</name> gave the Asian XI a good start as they reached 59-0 in the 10th over. But wickets regularly tumbled once he fell to a catch in the deep trying to hit Warne's second ball for six.

<name>Vettori</name> got stuck into the middle order where <name>Dravid</name> played a lone hand with only <name>Kumar Sangakkara</name> - <name>Gough's<name> sole victim - providing any meaningful support. The World XI were further boosted by the presence of <name>Steve Waugh</name> as a substitute fielder towards the end of the match. It was all wrapped up in the 40th over with the run out of <name>Murali</name> for a duck. Man of the match Ponting said: "The whole day has been very, very special. "It's great that the cricket community around the world can play a huge part to raise some money to put a smile on some faces around the world." Asian XI captain <name>Sourav Ganguly</name> said: "I hope we have contributed in whatever way we can to help the people who have suffered this disaster."
