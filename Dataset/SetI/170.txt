Ireland surge past Scots

Ireland maintained their Six Nations Grand Slam ambitions with an impressive victory over Scotland at Murrayfield.

<name>Hugo Southwell's</name> try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks <name>Malcolm O'Kelly</name> and <name>Paul O'Connell</name> put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing <name>Denis Hickie</name> and third penalty from <name>Ronan O'Gara</name>, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. <name>Jon Petrie</name> scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from <name>John Hayes</name> and <name>Gavin Duffy</name> sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, <name>Eddie O'Sullivan'</name> side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach <name>Matt Williams</name> a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker <name>Jason White</name> was carried on by <name>Ali Hogg</name> and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed <name>Paterson</name> to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.

If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when <name>Paterson's</name> searing break and <name>Andy Craig's</name> pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. <name>Paterson</name> was off target with the conversion and fly-half <name>Dan Parks</name> then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an <name>O'Gara</name> penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. <name>Stuart Grimes</name> pulled down <name>O'Kelly</name> at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.

<name>O'Gara</name> added the conversion and a further penalty, after <name>Shane Horgan</name> almost grabbed a second try from <name>O'Gara's</name> chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. <name>O'Connell</name> - skipper in the absence of <name>Brian O'Driscoll</name> - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.

Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker <name>Johnny O'Connor</name> won another vital turnover, and <name>O'Gara's</name> basketball pass sent <name>Hickie</name> over in the left corner. <name>O'Gara</name> converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from <name>Paterson</name> sparked them back to life just before the hour. <name>Stuart Grimes</name> won a line-out and a well-worked move saw <name>Petrie</name> scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. <name>Peter Stringer</name> and <name>O'Kelly</name> combined to put giant prop <name>Hayes</name> over in the right corner before replacement <name>Gavin Duffy</name> scorched away on the left, <name>David Humphreys</name> adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.
