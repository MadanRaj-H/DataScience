<name>Streak</name> set to make return

Former Zimbabwe captain <name>Heath Streak</name> has been recalled to the national squad and is available for Wednesday's final one-day match against South Africa.

<name>Streak</name>, who has ended his disagreement with Zimbabwe Cricket, said: "I'm looking forward to getting back. "Obviously there's an element of concern at not having played at this level for a while, but it's not like I haven't been playing cricket. "I had a good season at Warwickshire and have been playing club cricket." On Sunday, captain <name>Tatenda Taibu</name> said <name>Streak</name> and <name>Andy Blignaut</name> would be considered for the Test series in South Africa starting on 4 March. But now it looks as though - in the case of <name>Streak</name> - a comeback could be even more immediate. And Zimbabwe's team manager <name>Babu Memen</name> said: "It's very likely that he will play on Wednesday, and he will stay on for the Test series." Former captain <name>Streak</name>, 30, was sacked in April 2004 after criticising Zimbabwe Cricket's selection policies. Following <name>Streak's</name> dismissal, 14 white players resigned in protest but <name>Gavin Ewing</name> and <name>Barney Rogers</name> have already returned to the fold and <name>Blignaut</name> and <name>Streak</name> are poised to do likewise.

When <name>Streak</name> announced he had put aside his differences with ZC on Friday, the board's managing director <name>Ozias Bvute</name> announced: "Heath is immediately available for selection." Now, <name>Streak</name> says he will be happy to play under the new regime, with <name>Taibu</name> as captain. He said: "I've always played the best I can whether captain or not. I'll give as much as I can without stepping on <name>Tatenda's </name>toes. I'll be there for him to help and to lend the experience that I've gained." Meanwhile four other rebels - <name>Stuart Carlisle</name>, <name>Trevor Gripper</name>, <name>Neil Ferreira</name> and <name>Charles Coventry</name> - have decided to make themselves available for selection for the A team. A five-match one-day home series for Zimbabwe's second string against Bangladesh A starts on Thursday. Of the remaining rebels, <name>Craig Wishart</name> and <name>Gary Brent</name> have revealed they were not interested in returning, while <name>Ray Price</name>, <name>Sean Ervine</name>, <name>Travis Friend</name> and <name>Grant Flower</name> have opted for county cricket in England. The position of <name>Richard Sims</name> remains unclear.
