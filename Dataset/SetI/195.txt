"The first really kind of significant move I made I just knew that it wasn't going to happen for me," <name>Roddick</name> said. He decided to pass on a chance to win his second tour title in two weeks in part because he wants to be healthy for the US team's Davis Cup match against Croatia in a fortnight. "The repercussions of this injury wouldn't just affect me. It would affect my team-mates and playing for my country as well," <name>Roddick</name> said.
