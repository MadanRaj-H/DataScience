France may have beaten Scotland and England but they were tedious and uninspired throughout both matches. Wales, on the other hand, have played some fine rugby and have made their best start since they last won the title in 1994. They also have a good record at the Stade de France, having won their first two games there, in 1999 and 2001. Wales have made two changes from the team that thrashed Italy 38-8 in Rome.

<name>Kevin Morgan</name> takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague <name>Hal Luscombe<name> on the right wing. In the pack Neath-Swansea Ospreys forward <name>Ryan Jones</name> bas been brought on the blind-side flank to beef up the Wales back row in place of <name>Jonathan Thomas</name>. Wales coach <name>Mike Ruddock</name> is determined that his team will not go into their shells after their promising start to the championship. "<name>Graham Henry</name> (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said <name>Ruddock</name>. "That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."

Despite their stuttering displays in their first two games defending champions France are also unbeaten. Under-pressure coach <name>Bernard Laporte</name> has made four changes, with <name>Yannick Nyanga</name>, the debutant <name>Julien Laharrague</name>, <name>Aurelien Rougerie</name> and <name>Yannick Jauzion</name> coming into the side. France have been criticised for the absence of traditional "French flair" as they have ground their way to victory so far this year but captain <name>Fabien Pelous</name> sees hope on the horizon. "I get the impression we are getting better," he said. "Against Wales, which is different from the teams we have beaten, I hope we can show our proper game."
