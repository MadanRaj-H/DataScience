<name>Barkley</name> fit for match in Ireland

England centre <name>Olly Barkley</name> has been passed fit for Sunday's Six Nations clash with Ireland at Lansdowne Road.

<name>Barkley</name> withdrew from Bath's team for Friday's clash with Gloucester after suffering a calf injury in training. Gloucester centre <name>Henry Paul</name> has also been cleared to play after overcoming an ankle injury. England coach <name>Andy Robinson</name>, who names his team on Wednesday, has called up Bath prop <name>Duncan Bell</name> following <name>Phil Vickery's</name> broken arm. With <name>Vickery</name> sidelined for at least six weeks and <name>Julian White</name> out with a neck injury, <name>Bell</name> could make his England debut. <name>Bell</name>, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. "I thought I'd burned all my bridges with England when I expressed an interest in wanting to play for Wales, so it's fantastic to get this opportunity," he said. <name>Bell</name>, who featured in the England A side which beat France 30-20 10 days ago, added: "I recognise that I got into the England A squad because of injuries. "And it's the same again in getting into the senior squad. But now that I have this opportunity I intend to take it fully if selected and play my heart out for my country."

England coach <name>Andy Robinson</name> could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop <name>Andrew Sheridan</name> into his front row. But <name>Sheridan</name> favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped <name>Bell</name> - who was among the try-scorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in.
