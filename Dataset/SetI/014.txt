Clyde 0-5 Celtic

Celtic brushed aside Clyde to secure their place in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but only after a nervy and testing first half.

The home side's <name>Craig Bryson</name> had a goal chopped off before <name>Stan Varga</name> headed Celtic into the lead. <name>Alan Thompson</name> scored from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after <name>Shaun Maloney</name> had been fouled. <name>Stilian Petrov</name> slid in a third, <name>Varga</name> tapped in his second and <name>Craig Bellamy</name> completed the rout with a fine drive. <name>Bryn Halliwell</name> was the busier keeper early on, saving from <name>Bellamy</name>, <name>Chris Sutton</name> and <name>Juninho</name>. <name>Clyde</name> had the ball in the net after half-an-hour through a tremendous strike from <name>Bryson</name>, but the referee had already blown for a foul by <name>Petrov</name>. From the resulting free kick, <name>Darren Sheridan</name> curled the ball round the Celtic wall only for the post to deny him. Back at the other end, <name>Halliwell</name> did well to come off his line and block <name>Bellamy's</name> effort to lift the ball over him. The keeper misjudged a corner that <name>Stephane Henchoz</name> headed wide, but a similar scenario five minutes before the break led to the opening goal. The ball was delivered from the left and <name>Halliwell</name> was left floundering as <name>Varga</name> glanced the ball into the net.

<name>Maloney</name> replaced the injured <name>Sutton</name> at half time and he marked his first competitive appearance after a year out injured by helping his side take a two-goal lead just after the break. The young striker fired a free kick straight into the Clyde wall but as he collected the rebound, he was tripped by <name>Bryson</name> and Thompson converted the penalty. <name>Sheridan</name> and <name>Bellamy</name> were involved in something of a flare-up that led to both being booked after the intervention of the assistant referee. <name>Juninho</name> brought out another good save from <name>Halliwell</name> and then <name>Petrov</name> saw a tremendous effort come off the top of the bar. But <name>Petrov</name> and <name>Juninho</name> combined brilliantly to allow the Bulgarian to make it 3-0 on the hour mark - a quick one-two giving him the time and space to steer the ball past <name>Halliwell</name> from 12 yards. <name>Varga</name> got his second goal of the game as Celtic drove home their advantage - <name>Thompson</name> whipped in a corner from the right and the unmarked defender simply tapped the ball over the line from a couple of yards out. Celtic were utterly dominant by this stage and <name>Bellamy</name> opened his scoring account for the club after a fine move involving <name>Aiden McGeady</name>, <name>Jackie McNamara</name> and <name>Maloney</name> culminated in the <name>Welshman</name> hammering the ball into the net. <name>Halliwell</name> kept the deficit at five by pushing a <name>McGeady</name> shot wide as the game petered out.
