<name>Klinsmann</name> issues <name>Lehmann</name> warning

Germany coach <name>Jurgen Klinsmann</name> has warned goalkeeper <name>Jens Lehmann</name> he may have to quit Arsenal to keep his World Cup dreams alive.

<name>Lehmann</name> is understudy to <name>Oliver Kahn</name> in the German squad, but has lost his place to <name>Manuel Alumnia</name> at Highbury. <name>Klinsmann</name> said: "It will be difficult for any of our players if he is not a first-choice at his club. "If <name>Jens</name> is not Arsenal's number one keeper, that is a problem for me. He must be playing regularly." <name>Lehmann</name> is desperate to keep his place in the Germany squad when the country hosts the World Cup in 2006. <name>Klinsmann</name> added: "If he is not playing regularly he cannot be Germany's number one keeper, or even number two keeper. "The situation for <name>Jens</name> is that he is currently the number two keeper at Arsenal. This could be critical if it remains the same during next season."
