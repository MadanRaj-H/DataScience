<name>Kirwan</name> demands Italy consistency

Italy coach <name>John Kirwan</name> has challenged his side to match the performance they produced in pushing Ireland close when they meet Wales on Saturday.

Despite losing 28-17 in Sunday's Six Nations encounter, the Italians confirmed their continuing improvement. "Our goal is to match every side we face and against Ireland we showed we could do that," said <name>Kirwan</name>. "But the most important thing is that we build on that performance when we play Wales on Saturday." Italy's half-backs had a mixed afternoon, with recalled scrum-half <name>Alessandro Troncon</name> impressing but fly-half <name>Luciano Orquera</name> having an off-day with the boot. <name>Kirwan</name> said: "I was very happy with <name>Troncon</name>. He had an incredible game - he was very good in attack and defence. "<name>Orquera's</name> kicking was off but he showed great courage in defence. "He also followed the game plan. We have to give him confidence because he has the capability to do well."
