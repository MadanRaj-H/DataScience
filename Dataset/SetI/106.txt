<name>Slovakia</name> seal Hopman Cup success

<name>Slovakia</name> clinched the Hopman Cup for the second time by beating Argentina 3-0 in Saturday's final in Perth.

<name>Daniela Hantuchova</name> put the third seeds ahead, recovering from a terrible start to beat <name>Gisela Dulko</name> 1-6 6-4 6-4. <name>Dominik Hrbaty</name>, who had not lost a set in his three singles matches in the group stages, then upset world number seven <name>Guillermo Coria</name> 6-4 6-1. <name>Hantuchova</name> and <name>Hrbaty</name> then won the mixed doubles after <name>Coria</name> was forced to withdraw because of a sore back. <name>Slovakia's</name> win made up for last year's final defeat to the United States. "I would like to congratulate <name>Daniela</name>," <name>Hrbaty</name> said. "I was so nervous watching her today, I almost had a heart attack. "I also feel a little sorry for <name>Guillermo</name> because I get very excited whenever I play for my country. I show lots of emotions and played such good tennis."

World number 31 <name>Hantuchova</name>, ranked two places above <name>Dulko</name>, looked nervous as she dropped the first four games of the match. <name>Dulko</name>, who had lost all three of her singles matches in the group stages, grew in confidence and took the opening set in just 27 minutes. But <name>Hantuchova</name> hit back to take the next two and the match. "I was so nervous because I really wanted to win for the team and for <name>Dominik</name> as he played so well all week," she said. "I didn't think I was playing my best but I just tried to hang in there and fight hard for every point for my country." <name>Slovakia</name> won the Cup on their first appearance in 1998 when <name>Karol Kucera</name> and <name>Karina Habsudova</name> beat France.
