Australia dominate India

Third Test, Nagpur, day two (stumps):
Australia 398 v India 146-5

The home side closed on 146-5, 252 runs in arrears and still 53 short of avoiding the follow-on. <name>Glenn McGrath</name>, playing in his 100th Test, took 2-18 in 20 overs as <name>Mohammad Kaif</name> (47 not out) propped up an innings that crawled at two runs per over. Australia were earlier dismissed for 398, with <name>Michael Clarke</name> falling to <name>Zaheer Khan</name> (4-95) nine short of a ton. India did not take long in wrapping up Australia's innings at the start of the day, claiming the three remaining overnight wickets for 36 runs. <name>Jason Gillespie</name>, lbw to <name>Zaheer</name>, and <name>Kasprowicz</name>, bowled by <name>Agit Agarkar</name>, both fell cheaply, leaving <name>McGrath</name> as <name>Clarke's</name> last hope of a second Test century. The veteran enjoyed his stay at the crease with two hooked boundaries, and in the end it was he who remained unbeaten when <name>Clarke</name> edged behind to end an entertaining knock that included 13 boundaries.

India were given a typically blustery start by <name>Virender Sehwag</name>, who took four boundaries off <name>Gillespie's</name> first over. It forced skipper <name>Adam Gilchrist</name> to protect the boundary with a sweeper after just five overs, but having forced Australia on the defensive <name>Sehwag</name> soon gave his wicket away. Flashing hard at <name>McGrath</name>, the opener became the Aussie paceman's 447th victim when edging into the gloves of the athletic <name>Gilchrist</name>, diving high to his right. <name>Gillespie</name>, belted out of the attack by <name>Sehwag</name>, returned from the other end and struck immediately to have <name>Aakash Chopra</name> caught by <name>Warne</name> at slip for eight.

It left India 35-2 at lunch, and a very quiet period followed the interval as <name>Rahul Dravid</name> and the returning <name>Sachin Tendulkar</name> tried to block India to parity. The pair put on 15 runs in one ball shy of 13 dawdling overs before <name>Tendulkar</name> was trapped in front of stumps by <name>Gillespie</name> (2-47) for eight. The grassy Nagpur pitch meant <name>Shane Warne's</name> introduction was delayed until the 36th over, but two balls were all it took for the Test cricket's leading wicket-taker to add to his tally. In having <name>VVS Laxman</name> caught by <name>Clarke</name> in gully, <name>Warne</name> ousted him for the third time this series and reduced India to a perilous 75-4 in the process. <name>Dravid's</name> stay at the crease was a lengthy one but largely unproductive, and after consuming 140 balls for 21 runs he edged <name>McGrath</name> to slip. It was a predictable end after the veteran paceman had worked India's stand-in skipper over with an array of balls which leapt off the seam on a pitch more akin to Australian grounds.

At 103-5 India looked vulnerable, but <name>Kaif</name> and <name>Parthiv Patel</name> - fresh from their century stand in the second Test - showed heart in the fading light. It was not plain sailing for <name>Kaif</name> - a spurned run-out chance and a catch off a no-ball offered two reprieves - but he grew into his task and even managed a six off <name>Warne</name> over long-off. Although India's sixth wicket offered the home side hope, Australia were in a strong position to push for the victory that would award them a first series victory in India for 35 years.
