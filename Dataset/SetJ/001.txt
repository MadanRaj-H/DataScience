<name>Hayden</name> sets up Australia win

Second one-day international, Christchurch Australia 314-6 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 208 (40.4 overs) by 106 runs

<name>Ricky Ponting</name> (53) and <name>Damien Martyn</name> (58) provided the main support for <name>Hayden</name>, who hit two sixes and 12 fours. They eventually totalled 314-6 and the game was as good as over when New Zealand slumped to 73-6 in reply, with <name>Adam Gilchrist</name> taking five catches. <name>Daniel Vettori</name> made a rapid 83 but they were all out for 208 in the 41st over. New Zealand must now win all three remaining matches to take the series, but such a turn-round looked a remote possibility at Jade Stadium. Skipepr <name>Stephen Fleming</name> chose to put Australia in after winning the toss, with former rugby star <name>Jeff Wilson</name> included in the New Zealand team for his first one-day international since March 1993. He was taught a harsh lesson as his six overs cost 57 runs, with only left-arm spinner <name>Vettori</name> (0-31 from 10) able to exercise any measure of control over the Australian batsmen.

<name>Gilchrist</name> was caught behind off <name>Daryl Tuffey</name> from the second ball of the match but <name>Hayden</name> and <name>Ponting</name> set about putting things right with a stand of 99 for the second wicket. <name>Ponting</name> cleared the ropes twice as he raced to 50 off 51 balls, but only added three more before he was run out by <name>Hamish Marshall</name>. By then, <name>Hayden</name> was into his stride and he and <name>Martyn</name> added 133, although it took them 24 overs. <name>Martyn</name> was run out off the final ball of the 41st over, but the final nine cost the Kiwis 82 runs as Australia raised the tempo. <name>Hayden's</name> century came up off 110 balls but he eventually fell to a catch by <name>Wilson</name> off <name>Kyle Mills</name>, leaving <name>Michael Clarke</name> to add 23 off 13 balls and <name>Mike Hussey</name> 32 not out off 20 as the total mounted past 300.

The new ball pairing of <name>Brett Lee</name> and <name>Glenn McGrath</name> made short work of New Zealand's top order, claiming two wickets each - all of them catches behind the wicket by <name>Gilchrist</name>. He claimed another when <name>Andrew Symonds</name> found the edge of <name>Craig McMillan's</name> bat and when <name>Chris Cairns</name> followed for 22, caught by <name>Hayden</name>, the home side were in danger of being embarrassed. <name>Vettori</name> and <name>Brendon McCullum</name> (20) halted their decline by sharing a stand of 62 before <name>McCullum</name> gave a return catch to <name>Symonds</name>, who finished with 3-41. <name>Wilson</name> made 22 in an eighth wicket stand of 62 but the end came quickly once he was caught by <name>Ponting</name> off <name>Jason Gillespie</name>. Having passed fifty for the first time in a limited overs international, <name>Vettori</name> was denied a century when he was caught at deep square leg off <name>Gillespie</name> after hitting 10 fours in his 77-ball knock. <name>Mills</name> was last to go, run out by <name>Clarke</name>, after setting off for a quick single and being sent back by <name>Tuffey</name>.
