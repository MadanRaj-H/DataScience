<name>Kaif</name> absence wrong - <name>Azharuddin</name>

India were wrong to leave <name>Mohammad Kaif</name> out of their squad for the first Test against Pakistan, according to former captain <name>Mohammad Azharuddin</name>.

<name>Azharuddin</name>, serving a life ban for match-fixing, feels the middle-order batsman deserves another chance. "<name>Kaif</name> batted very well against Australia on a tough wicket," Azharuddin told BBC Sport. "He's got a lot of talent and I am sure he cannot be held back. His omission is not good for his confidence." <name>Kaif</name> scored two fifties in last year's home series loss to the Aussies, while <name>Yuvraj Singh</name> failed badly against the same opponents yet was given a squad berth for the Mohali Test starting on 8 March.

<name>Azharuddin</name> reckons <name>Vangipurappu Laxman</name> should bat at first drop despite struggling for form. "<name>Laxman</name> has always played well when he has gone as number three," he said. "Lower down the order, a lot of pressure is on him and if I were the captain, I would have played him at number three." As well as spinners <name>Harbhajan Singh</name> and <name>Anil Kumble</name>, India have four pacemen to choose from after naming <name>Ashish Nehra</name>, <name>Lakshmipathy Balaji</name>, <name>Irfan Pathan</name> and <name>Zaheer Khan</name> in the 14-man squad. "All the four pace bowlers deserve to get into the team," <name>Azharuddin</name> added. Pakistan, minus injured paceman <name>Shoaib Akhtar</name>, are due to arrive in India on Monday ahead of their first warm-up match against the Indian Board President's XI starting on Thursday. "<name>Shoaib Akhtar's</name> absence in the Pakistani side is not going to make much of a difference," <name>Azharuddin</name> opined. "He may get a wicket or two but he has to be more consistent. Also, the Indian batting is very strong now."

<name>Azharuddi</name>n maintains his innocence despite his central involvement in the match-fixing scandal of 2000 which saw Pakistani <name>Salim Malik</name> and the late <name>Hansie Cronje</name> of South Africa also receive life bans. In 99 Tests for India from 1984 to 2000, <name>Azharuddin</name> scored 6,215 runs at an average of 45 with 22 centuries.
