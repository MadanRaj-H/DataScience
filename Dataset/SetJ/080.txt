<name>Young</name> debut cut short by <name>Ginepri</name>

Fifteen-year-old <name>Donald Young's</name> first appearance in an ATP tennis tournament proved brief as the teenager went out in round one of the San Jose Open.

<name>Young</name> shot to the top of the junior world rankings when he won the boys' singles at January's Australian Open. But the wildcard entry was dispatched by fellow American <name>Robby Ginepri</name> in straight sets, 6-2 6-2, in California. Despite that he was happy with his Tour debut. "It was fun. I had my chances, but they didn't come through," he said. <name>Young</name>, who beat two players ranked in the top 200 when he was just 14, was only 2-1 down in the first set before losing 10 of the next 13 games. And <name>Ginepri</name> - six years older than the youngest player to ever win a junior slam and top the global standings - admitted he was impressed.

"He's very talented," said <name>Ginepri</name>. "He's got a long future ahead of him. "Being left-handed, he was very quick around the court. "His serve is a little deceptive. He came into the net and volleyed better than I thought." Earlier, South Korean <name>Hyung-Taik Lee</name> defeated American J<name>an-Michael Gambill</name> 6-3 7-6 (7-4). American <name>Kevin Kim</name> defeated <name>Jan Hernych</name> of the Czech Republic 7-5 6-3, Canadian qualifier <name>Frank Dancevic</name> downed American <name>Jeff Morrison</name> 4-6 7-6 (7-3) 6-0, and Denmark's <name>Kenneth Carlsen</name> beat <name>Irakli Labadze</name> of the Republic of Georgia 6-7 (4-7) 6-2 6-3. Top seed <name>Andy Roddick</name> launches his defence of the title on Wednesday against qualifier <name>Paul Goldstein</name>. Second seed <name>Andre Agassi</name> opens his campaign on Tuesday against wildcard <name>Bobby Reynolds</name>, last year's US collegiate champion. <name>Agassi</name> has won the San Jose five times, but his run of three straight titles ended last year when he fell to <name>Mardy Fish</name> in the semi-finals. <name>Fish</name> went on to lose to <name>Roddick</name> in the final.
