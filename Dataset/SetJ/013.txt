England slump to defeat

Fourth one-day international, Cape Town: South Africa 291-5 (50 overs) beat England 183 all out (41.2 overs) by 108 runs

The home side tallied a massive 291-5, with <name>Gibbs</name> making 100, <name>Jacques Kallis</name> 71 and <name>Justin Kemp</name> 57 from 36 balls. In reply, England were three wickets down inside eight overs, and bowled out for 183 in 41.2 overs. <name>Kevin Pietersen</name> smashed 75 from 85 balls but was caught in the deep trying to up the tempo. In all, 13 sixes were hit at a sun-baked Newlands, <name>Kemp</name> accounting for four of them with three each for <name>Gibbs</name> and <name>Pietersen</name>. <name>Gibbs</name> and <name>Kallis</name>, who both play for home side Western Province, set a new mark for the third wicket at this ground and beat their own record - set last week - for the third wicket against England with a stand of 143.

They set an even pace, notching half-centuries from successive deliveries, but still looked under par when <name>Kallis</name> was run out by a brilliant direct throw from <name>Paul Collingwood</name> at point. However, <name>Kemp</name> helped add 98 in the last 10 overs of the South African innings, building brutally on that platform. <name>Kemp's</name> best six came off <name>Darren Gough</name>, a drive into the pavilion at long on, and <name>Gough</name> was actually hanging on to one of <name>Gibbs'</name> maximums, the momentum carrying him over the boundary rope. England looked like keeping pace only as far as the sixth over of their reply, when <name>Geraint Jones</name> edged <name>Ntini</name> behind with 32 on the board.

Captain <name>Michael Vaughan</name>, who returned from illness and replaced <name>Vikram Solanki</name> in the line-up, followed for a duck in the next over, edging <name>Shaun Pollock</name> to slip. And <name>Marcus Trescothick</name> went four balls later, playing around an <name>Ntini</name> yorker which took out his middle stump. <name>Andrew Strauss</name>, who made 17, and <name>Paul Collingwood</name>, with 11, both settled but failed to move on. And <name>Pietersen</name> was left to stage his own firework display, falling to his third successive slog-sweep off spinner <name>Nicky Boje</name> after the first two had flown over the square-leg boundary.

<name>Pietersen</name>, sporting a new hairstyle with a diagonal streak of bleached blond, took his series figures to 238 runs at an average of 119. <name>Ntini</name> had Ashley Giles caught at cover for 20 to finish with 3-29. Ignoring the fact that the team batting first has won 17 of the last 25 one-day internationals at the Cape Town ground, <name>Vaughan</name> had opted to put the home side in on winning the toss. He was forced into making changes early, though, as <name>Steve Harmison</name> struggled in his first match back from a calf injury. The pace bowler, who replaced <name>Matthew Hoggard</name> in the line-up, conceded 24 runs off his first three overs, including four wides.

Although <name>Darren Gough</name> dismissed <name>AB de Villiers</name> lbw, he was also wayward early. And it took the arrival of <name>Kabir Ali</name> as the first-change bowler to apply the brakes. <name>Ali</name>, the hero of Wednesday's tie in Bloemfontein dismissed <name>Graeme Smith</name>, the hero of Friday's victory, lbw with a straight delivery that may have been a little too high. And with <name>Collingwood</name> in support his first six-over spell brought figures of 1-11. <name>Ali's</name> early figures were decimated, though, in the closing stages as <name>Gibbs</name> and <name>Kemp</name> blazed to put the match out of reach. The teams meet again in East London on Wednesday for the fifth instalment of the seven-match series.
