<name>Kaif</name> shines in India win

First one-day international, Chittagong: India 245-8 (50 overs) v Bangladesh 234-8 (50 overs) by 11 runs

<name>Mohammad Kaif</name> (80) and <name>Rahul Dravid</name> (53) shared a stand of 128 as the tourists posted a total of 245-8. Skipper <name>Habibul Bashar</name> kept Bangladesh in the hunt with 65, but his departure left them with too much to do. <name>Khaled Mashud</name> hit an unbeaten 50 but Sridharan Sriram took 3-43 as the home side were restricted to 234-8. After winning the Test series 2-0, India took the opportunity to rest batsman <name>Virender Sehwag</name> and fast bowler <name>Zaheer Khan</name> and give debuts to wicket-keeper <name>Mahendra Dhoni</name> and seamer <name>Joginder Sharma</name>. But skipper <name>Sourav Ganguly</name> lost the toss and opposite number <name>Bashar's</name> decision to put them in paid off initially as India were reduced to 45-3. Ganguly was bowled for nought by the second ball of the match from <name>Tapash Baisya</name> and 17-year-old <name>Nazmul Hossain</name> then claimed the prized scalp of <name>Sachin Tendulkar</name>, who was caught behind for 19.

<name>Mushfiqur Rahman</name> trapped <name>Yuvraj Singh</name> lbw for 21, but <name>Kaif </name>and <name>Dravid</name> steadied the innings and Bangladesh had to wait 28 overs for their next success. Both batsmen reached their half centuries off 74 balls, but <name>Dravid</name> edged a catch to the keeper off <name>Khaled Mahmud</name> soon after and <name>Sriram</name> was stumped for three off spinner <name>Mohammad Rafique</name>. <name>Dhoni's</name> first innings for India lasted one delivery as he was run out for nought and when <name>Kaif</name> gave a return catch to <name>Nazmul</name> in the 47th over, the total had only just passed 200. But <name>Ajit Agarkar</name> made 25 and <name>Irfan Pathan</name> hit two sixes in his 21 not out off 11 balls, runs which ultimately made all the difference.

Bangladesh were soon in trouble in reply as <name>Rafique</name> (eight), <name>Nafis Iqbal</name> (nine) and <name>Mohammad Ashraful</name> (two) all failed - the latter becoming <name>Sharma's</name> first international victim when he was caught by <name>Ganguly</name>. <name>Bashar</name> and <name>Aftab Ahmed</name> put on 64 in 14 overs before both fell victim to <name>Sriram's</name> left-arm spin, along with <name>Rajin Saleh</name> (14), as the home side slumped from 108-3 to 156-6. <name>Mushfique</name> was lbw to <name>Agarkar</name> for two but <name>Mashud</name> and <name>Mahmud</name> did their best to revive their side, adding 40 for the eighth wicket in six overs. The target was out of reach, however, and <name>Mahmud</name> perished for 21 to a catch by Man of the Match <name>Kaif</name> as Bangladesh's hopes were finally extinguished. <name>Mashud</name> had the consolation of reaching his fifth one-day half century before <name>Baisya</name> drove the final ball of the game to extra cover for four, but it was too late for Bangladesh.
