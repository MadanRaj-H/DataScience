Arsenal through on penalties

Arsenal win 4-2 on penalties

The Spanish goalkeeper saved from <name>Alan Quinn</name> and <name>Jon Harley</name> as Arsenal sealed a quarter-final trip to Bolton with a 4-2 victory on penalties. <name>Lauren</name>, <name>Patrick Vieira</name>, <name>Freddie Ljungberg</name> and <name>Ashley Cole</name> scored for Arsenal, while <name>Andy Gray</name> and <name>Phil Jagielka</name> were on target for the Blades. <name>Michael Tonge</name> and <name>Harley</name> wasted chances for the underdogs, but <name>Paddy Kenny</name> was inspired to keep Arsenal at bay. Arsenal, stripped of attacking talent such as <name>Thierry Henry</name> and <name>Dennis Bergkamp</name>, partnered 17-year-old Italian striker <name>Arturo Lupoli</name> with <name>Ljungberg</name> up front. It was a revamped Arsenal line-up, and they were almost a goal behind within seconds as <name>Tonge</name> wasted a glorious chance. <name>Gray</name> ran free down the right flank, and his cross left <name>Tonge</name> with the simplest of chances, but he blazed over the top from six yards.

Arsenal were barely seen as an attacking force in the opening 45 minutes, although <name>Ljungberg</name> turned a half-chance wide after good work by <name>Cesc Fabregas</name>. <name>Arsene Wenger</name> introduced <name>Quincy Owusu-Abeyie</name> for the ineffective <name>Lupoli</name> at half-time, and the pacy Dutch youngster had an immediate impact. He ran clear after good work by <name>Mathieu Flamini</name>, but his finish was tame and <name>Kenny</name> saved easily. <name>Owusu-Abeyie</name> then fired in a testing cross, which was met by <name>Fabregas</name>, and it needed a desperate clearance by <name>Kenny's</name> legs to save the Blades. Arsenal were now totally dominant, and were desperately unlucky not to take the lead after 62 minutes when <name>Fabregas</name> crashed a rising drive against the bar from 20 yards. It then took a brilliant tackle by <name>Jagielka</name> to deny <name>Ljungberg</name> as he was poised to strike. Arsenal continued to press, and once again <name>Kenny</name> was called into action with eight minutes left, diving low to clutch another close-range effort from <name>Fabregas</name>. <name>Neil Warnock's</name> side almost snatched victory in the dying seconds when <name>Derek Geary's</name> cross found <name>Harley</name> at the far post, but his diving header was brilliantly turned over by <name>Almunia</name>. <name>Owusu-Abeyie's</name> pace was causing all sorts of problems for the Blades, and as extra-time began, another surging run into the penalty area almost set up a chance for <name>Ljungberg</name>. Pascal Cygan missed Arsenal's best chance after 106 minutes, blazing across the face of goal when he was unmarked at the far post. Arsenal sent on <name>Jeremie Aliadiere</name> with seven minutes of extra-time left, and he almost broke the deadlock with his first touch. <name>Kolo Toure's</name> misplaced free-kick landed at his feet, but <name>Kenny</name> once again blocked from a tight angle. Arsenal laid siege to Sheffield United's goal in the dying minutes, but they somehow held on to force penalties. <name>Almunia</name> was then Arsenal's hero as another brave Blades cup campaign came to a losing end.
