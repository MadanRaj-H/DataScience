<name>Hantuchova</name> in Dubai last eight

<name>Daniela Hantuchova</name> moved into the quarter-finals of the Dubai Open, after beating <name>Elene Likhotseva</name> of Russia 7-5 6-4, and now faces <name>Serena Williams</name>.

Australian Open champion <name>Williams</name> survived an early scare to beat Russia's <name>Elena Bovina</name> 1-6 6-1 6-4. World number one <name>Lindsay Davenport</name> and <name>Anastasia Myskina</name> also progressed. <name>Davenport</name> defeated China's <name>Jie Zheng</name> 6-2 7-5, while French Open champion <name>Myskina</name> sailed through after her opponent <name>Marion Bartoli</name> retired hurt. American <name>Davenport</name> will now face fellow former Wimbledon champion, <name>Conchita Martinez</name> of Spain, who ousted seventh-seeded <name>Nathalie Dechy</name> of France 6-1 6-2. <name>Myskina<.name> will face eighth-seed <name>Patty Schnyder</name> from Switzerland, who defeated China's <name>Li Na</name> 6-3 7-6 (10-8). The other quarter final pits wild card <name>Sania Mirza</name> of India against <name>Jelena Jankovic</name> of Serbia and Montenegro, who both won on Tuesday.

Before her meeting with <name>Martinez</name>, <name>Davenport</name> believes there is some room for improvement in her game. "I started well and finished well, but played some so-so games in the middle," she said. <name>Williams</name> was also far from content. "I don't know what I was doing there," she said. "It was really windy and I hadn't played in the wind. All my shots were going out of here." But <name>Hantuchova</name> is in upbeat mood ahead of her clash with the younger <name>Williams</name> sister, who was handed a first-round bye. "I feel I have an advantage (over <name>Serena</name>) because I have already played two matches on these courts," she said. "It is a difficult court to play on. Very fast and sometimes you feel you have no control over the ball."
