<name>Parmar</name> ruled out of Davis Cup tie

A knee injury has forced <name>Arvind Parmar</name> out of Great Britain's Davis Cup tie in Israel and left <name>Alex Bogdanovic</name> in line to take the second singles place.

<name>Parmar<name> picked up the injury last week and has failed to recover in time for the Europe/Africa Zone I tie, which begins in Tel Aviv on Friday. <name>Bogdanovic</name> looks set to take the second singles place alongside <name>Greg Rusedski</name>. GB captain <name>Jeremy Bates</name> could use 17-year-old <name>Andrew Murray</name> and <name>David Sherwood</name> in the doubles rubber. <name>Bogdanovic</name> and <name>Murray</name> both pulled out of tournaments last week through injury but are expected to be fit. <name>Jamie Delgado</name> and <name>Lee Childs</name> have been called into the squad in Tel Aviv as designated hitters for team practice but <name>Bates</name> has no plans to call either of them into his squad at present.

The unheralded <name>Sherwood</name> was the surprise inclusion when the squad was announced last week, and <name>Bates</name> said: "<name>David</name> has earned his place in this squad on the merit of his form and results over the last 12 months." The 6ft 4in <name>Sherwood</name> is ranked 264th in the world and the LTA have high hopes for him after Futures tournament wins in Wrexham and Edinburgh.

The Sheffield-born right-hander, aged 24, also reached another final in Plaisir, France, a week after making the semi-final in Mulhouse. <name>Bates</name> is glad to have <name>Rusedski</name> available after <name>Tim Henman's</name> retirement from Davis Cup tennis. "His wealth of experience is invaluable, particularly to the younger players and I know he will lead by example," <name>Bates</name> said. "We are looking forward to the tie. The squad are all in excellent form."
