South Africa recall <name>Boje</name>

South Africa have recalled spinner <name>Nicky Boje</name> for the first Test against England, which begins on 17 December.

<name>Boje</name> missed the recent tour of India because of fears he would be called in for questioning by Indian police over match-fixing allegations. Pace bowler <name>Dale Steyn</name> and opening batsmen <name>AB de Villiers</name> are new faces in a 13-man squad. Despite suffering poor form in India, new wicket-keeper <name>Thami Tsolekile</name> has been preferred to <name>Mark Boucher</name>. There is no place for opener <name>Herschelle Gibbs</name>, who has been struggling with a finger injury after missing the India trip, and spin all-rounder <name>Justin Ontong</name> has been dropped. <name>Nicky Boje</name>, who underwent minor surgery to remove a growth in his neck, will have to pass a fitness test before the match. <name>Port Elizabeth</name>, where the first Test is being held, is South Africa's most spin-friendly venue.
