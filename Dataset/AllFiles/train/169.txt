Wales make two changes for France

Wales coach <name>Mike Ruddock</name> has made two changes from the team that beat Italy 38-8 for Saturday's trip to France.

<name>Kevin Morgan</name> takes over from his injured Newport-Gwent Dragons colleague <name>Hal Luscombe</name> on the right wing. And in the pack Neath-Swansea <name>Ospreys</name> forward <name>Ryan Jones</name> is preferred at blindside flanker to <name>Jonathan Thomas</name>. <name>Thomas</name>, a try-scorer in Rome, drops down to the bench instead of <name>Ian Gough</name>, while <name>Cardiff</name> back <name>Rhys Williams</name> steps up in place of <name>Morgan</name>. <name>Luscombe</name> is sidelined by a hamstring problem sustained during the Six Nations game against Italy last weekend.

However, the experienced and in-form <name>Morgan</name> was already pushing hard for a start at Stade de France. "Due to his impressive performances from the bench, <name>Kevin</name> was very much in the selection mix anyway, and the unfortunate injury to <name>Hal</name> gives him the chance to start," said <name>Ruddock</name>. "Now that <name>Ryan Jones</name> has recovered from injury, we have increased the options in the back row. "<name>Jonathan Thomas</name> is unlucky to lose his spot after performing well against Italy and scoring a try, but such is the competition for places that every position is debated in detail. "For this particular game, we felt we might not always be afforded the open spaces out wide we were able to exploit against Italy, so an extra big ball-carrier in the back-row is thought to be necessary on this occasion. "Obviously, it's a 22-man game these days, and there is every chance that <name>Jonathan</name> will be making an impact from the bench." Wales have beaten France on two of their last three visits to Paris, and another victory this time around would keep them firmly on course for a first Five or Six Nations title triumph since 1994. "<name>Graham Henry</name> (former Wales coach) said a couple of years ago that we should 'be bold' when going to France, and he was proved right," said <name>Ruddock</name>. "That is a great way to approach the game, and something we will further endorse with the players this week."
