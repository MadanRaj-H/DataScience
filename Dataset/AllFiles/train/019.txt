<name>Wright-Phillips</name> to start on right

England coach <name>Sven-Goran Eriksson</name> has revealed <name>Shaun Wright-Phillips</name> will start against the Netherlands.

But <name>Wright-Phillips</name> will not make his first start for England playing on the left, as had been widely expected. "<name>Shaun Wright-Phillips</name> will probably start the game," said <name>Eriksson</name>. "But I'm not going to start <name>Wright-Phillips</name> on the left." <name>Eriksson</name> also revealed that <name>Wes Brown</name> will start alongside <name>Jamie Carragher</name> in the injury-hit centre of defence. When asked if <name>Brown</name> and <name>Carragher</name> would start <name>Eriksson</name> replied: "I could tell you yes. "It's a blow that four or five central defenders are away because of injuries. "On the other hand it's good for <name>Carragher</name> and Brown to show what they can do at this level. That's positive." The England coach said that he had been impressed by <name>Wright-Phillips'</name> form for Manchester City. "He deserves his chance. He has been playing well all season and I look forward to seeing him." And he added that <name>Andy Johnson</name> and <name>Stewart Downing</name> - the other two new players in the squad - would also get a chance to impress. "<name>Wright-Phillips</name>, <name>Downing</name> and <name>Johnson</name> will start or get the chance to play some part. "<name>Johnson</name> was not in my plans a year ago but he is doing a great season and scoring a lot of goals. "<name>Downing</name> is another one making a great season. He is young, talented and there are not too many left-footed players in the squad."
