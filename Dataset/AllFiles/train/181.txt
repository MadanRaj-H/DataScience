Ireland are going for their first Grand Slam since 1948 after two opening wins, and England represent their sternest test of the Championship so far. England were sloppy and leaderless in the defeats against Wales and France and another loss would be unthinkable. The pressure is on coach <name>Andy Robinson</name> and his side have to deliver.

Despite England's dramatic dip in form since the World Cup final - they have lost eight of their last 13 matches - Ireland coach <name>Eddie O'Sullivan</name> says his side should not underestimate the visitors. "Had they kicked their points they would have beaten France and that would have created a different landscape for Sunday," he said. "This is England we are talking about. They have a depth of talent and a very good record against Ireland. "They will target a victory in Dublin as the turning point in their Six Nations." The differences between the sides is also highlighted in the team selections for the Dublin encounter.

Ireland, despite having <name>Gordon D'Arcy</name> still out injured, have been boosted by the return of star skipper <name>Brian O'Driscoll</name> who missed the Scotland game with a hamstring injury. "The knowledge that the England game was coming up really helped during rehabilitation," he said. "The will to play in this game was enormous. It doesn't get much bigger than England at home." As well as entering the tournament without players like <name>Jonny Wilkinson</name>, <name>Mike Tindall</name> and <name>Richard Hill</name>, England have now lost two tighthead props in <name>Julian White</name> and <name>Phil Vickery</name> while blind-side flanker <name>Lewis Moody</name> is a major concern. <name>Robinson</name>, who received a lot of flak for the inclusion and then dropping of centre <name>Mathew Tait</name>, has kept faith with kicking fly-half <name>Charlie Hodgson</name> despite his horror show at Twickenham. If England slump in Dublin, it will be their worst run of results in the Championship since 1987.

But <name>Robinson</name> was bullish during the week about the game, saying that his side "are going there to get in their faces", and has identified the line-out and tackle area as the key to England's chances. And despite the recent results, skipper <name>Jason Robinson</name> believes there is nothing wrong with the mood in the camp. "There is no lack of confidence in the team," said the Sale full-back. "We have had a good week's training and we are all looking forward to the challenge. "I still believe in this team. I know if we get our game right we will win the games."
