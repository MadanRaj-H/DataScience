<name>Henman</name> to face Saulnier test

British number one <name>Tim Henman</name> will face France's <name>Cyril Saulnier</name> in the first round of next week's Australian Open.

<name>Greg Rusedski</name>, the British number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face <name>Andy Roddick</name> in the second round if he beats Swede <name>Jonas Bjorkman</name>. Local favourite <name>Lleyton Hewitt</name> will meet France's <name>Arnaud Clement</name>, while defending champion and world number one <name>Roger Federer</name> faces <name>Fabrice Santoro</name>. Women's top seed <name>Lindsay Davenport</name> drew Spanish veteran <name>Conchita Martinez</name>.

<name>Henman</name> came from two sets down to defeat <name>Saulnier</name> in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year's first major and is lined up to meet <name>Roddick</name> in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. "He's tough player on any surface, he's got a lot of ability," he said. "We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I'm going to need to play well from the outset because he's a dangerous competitor." Switzerland's Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten <name>Santoro</name> in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. "It's a tricky match," <name>Federer</name> said. "I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. "The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them." The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion <name>Andre Agassi</name> in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian <name>Marat Safin</name>, the player he beat in last year's final.

Eighth-seeded American <name>Agassi</name> is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed <name>Andy Roddick</name> will open his campaign against <name>Irakli Labadze</name> of Georgia. The American could meet <name>Rusedski</name> in the second round, seventh seed <name>Henman</name> in the quarter-finals and <name>Hewitt</name> in the last four. <name>Hewitt</name> is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since <name>Mark Edmondson</name> in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to <name>Federer</name>, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. <name>Safin</name>, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed <name>Tommy Haas</name>, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.

In the women's draw, <name>Davenport</name> could encounter eighth-seeded <name>Venus Williams</name> in the quarter-finals and third-ranked <name>Anastasia Myskina</name>, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled <name>Davenport</name>, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. <name>Venus Williams</name>, who lost to younger sister <name>Serena</name> in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against <name>Eleni Daniilidou</name> of Greece. <name>Serena Williams</name>, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 Australian Open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed <name>Amelie Mauresmo</name>, a runner-up in 1999. <name>Serena</name> will open against another Frenchwoman <name>Camille Pin</name>, while <name>Mauresmo</name> plays Australia's <name>Samantha Stosur</name>. Wimbledon champion <name>Maria Sharapova</name>, seeded fourth, drew a qualifier in the first round but could meet fellow Russian <name>Svetlana Kuznetsova</name>, the US Open winner, in the last eight
