<name>Sharapova</name> overcomes tough <name>Molik</name>

Wimbledon champion <name>Maria Sharapova</name> recovered from losing the opening set to win the final of the Qatar Open.

The second seed beat fourth-seeded Australian <name>Alicia Molik</name> 4-6 6-1 6-4 for her second title of the year. <name>Molik</name>, who had overcome top seed <name>Amelie Mauresmo</name> in Friday's semi-final, broke <name>Sharapova</name> in the third game of a first set she went on to win. But <name>Sharapova</name> recovered to build up a healthy 5-0 lead in the second set and she never looked back after that. <name>Molik</name> saw her game fall apart as <name>Sharapova</name> broke in the fifth game of the decider to lead 3-2. And although <name>Molik</name> stayed in touch, <name>Sharapova</name> held on to her serve and then finished off the match with an ace after saving a break point in the 10th game.

<name>Sharapova</name> said the key to her victory was her positive approach after losing the first set. "<name>Alicia</name> was dictating terms to me in the first set but in my mind I was always positive," said <name>Sharapova</name>. "In the first set I was not playing my own game, but in the second I decided to put some pace on the ball and put pressure on her serve and that worked." <name>Sharapova</name> said she will head to Los Angeles to be with her mother and have some rest after her recent hectic schedule. "I need some rest now and I am eager to see my mum and catch up with friends after all the travelling I've been doing."
