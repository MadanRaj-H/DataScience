<name>Clijsters</name> sets up Venus match-up

<name>Kim Clijsters</name> continued her comeback from a wrist injury with a 7-5 6-7 6-1 win over Russia's <name>Nadia Petrova</name> in round two of the Antwerp Diamond Games.

The Belgian will meet fellow former world number one <name>Venus Williams</name> in the quarter-finals after the American swept past France's <name>Virginie Razzano</name> 6-3 6-0. <name>Clijsters</name>, sidelined since October, edged a high-quality first set. But <name>Petrova</name> hit back in a second-set tiebreak before <name>Clijsters</name> pulled clear in the decider, breaking three times. "Everything's fine with the wrist," said <name>Clijsters</name>. "I could do everything I wanted to with my backhand - long backhand cross rallies, slicing. I really enjoyed every backhand.

"I had the intention of wearing <name>Petrova</name> down and I did. It was a relief to win a three-set match. "These are the kind of matches I have been looking forward to for a long time." And the Belgian is looking forward to facing a severe test from <name>Williams</name>. "A quarter-final against <name>Venus</name> is a nice prospect," said <name>Clijsters</name>. "I saw her play and she is very strong right now, completely focused. "It will be difficult on Friday, but fun as well." Third seed <name>Williams</name>, who will get a gold and diamond-encrusted racket should she add to her 2002 and 2003 event wins, was barely troubled against <name>Razzano</name>. "My tennis was very good today," she said. "But it is no surprise to me because I feel very healthy and have been working well lately."
