Fit-again <name>Betsen</name> in France squad

France have brought flanker <name>Serge Betsen</name> back into their squad to face England at Twickenham on Sunday.

But the player, who missed the victory over Scotland through injury, must attend a disciplinary hearing on Wednesday after being cited by Wasps. "Serge has a good case so we are confident he will play," said France coach <name>Bernard Laporte</name>. The inexperienced <name>Nicolas Mas</name>, <name>Jimmy Marlu</name> and <name>Jean-Philippe Grandclaude</name> are also included in a 22-man squad. The trio have been called up after <name>Pieter de Villiers</name>, <name>Ludovic Valbon</name> and <name>Aurelien Rougerie</name> all picked up injuries in France's 16-9 win on Saturday.

<name>Laporte</name> said he was confident that <name>Betsen</name> would be cleared by the panel investigating his alleged trip that broke Wasps centre <name>Stuart Abbott's</name> leg. "If he was to be suspended, we would call up <name>Imanol Harinordoquy</name> or <name>Thomas Lievremont</name>," said <name>Laporte</name>, who has dropped <name>Patrick Tabacco</name>. "We missed <name>Serge</name> badly against Scotland. He has now recovered from his thigh injury and played on Saturday with Biarritz." France's regular back-row combination of <name>Betsen</name>, <name>Harinordoquy</name> and <name>Olivier Magne</name> were all missing from France's side at the weekend because of injury. <name>Laporte</name> is expected to announce France's starting line-up on Wednesday.
