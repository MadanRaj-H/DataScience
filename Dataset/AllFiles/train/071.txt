Unclear future for striker <name>Baros</name>

Liverpool forward <name>Milan Baros</name> is uncertain whether he remains part of boss <name>Rafa Benitez's</name> plans after being dropped for the Carling Cup final.

<name>Baros</name>, who is Liverpool's leading scorer this season, denied reports of a row with <name>Benitez</name> but claims he is mystified at being left on the bench. He told Czech newspaper Daily Sport: "I don't know why I didn't play on Sunday. I didn't argue with anybody. "I was disappointed but I am not thinking of leaving right now." The Czech international came on as a substitute after 74 minutes but could not prevent his side losing 3-2 to Chelsea after extra-time.

<name>Baros</name> denied suggestions he wanted to leave the Millennium Stadium before the match upon learning of his omission from the starting line-up. But his admission that he "guessed something like this was going to happen on Saturday", will do little to quell claims of a falling-out with <name>Benitez</name>. And although <name>Baros</name> insisted thoughts of quitting Anfield are "not in my mind right now", he admitted "everything is possible".
