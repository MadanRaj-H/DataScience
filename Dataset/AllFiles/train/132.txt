Officials respond in court row

Australian tennis' top official has defended the Australian Open courts at Melbourne Park after criticism of the playing surface by <name>Lleyton Hewitt</name>.

<name>Hewitt</name> said he had had a "gutful" of trying to persuade them to make the surface faster but Tennis Australia's <name>Geoff Pollard</name> rejected his comments. "We did ask for it to be made faster than last year and, to my knowledge, it is faster," he said. "We spent a substantial amount of money on modifications to make it faster." <name>Hewitt</name>, who has not got past the fourth round at Melbourne in seven attempts, had earlier said the surface was not worthy of such a prestigious tournament. But he said he would play on whatever surface he had to in order to have a chance of winning. The tournament starts on 17 January, and <name>Pollard</name> said the surface had been speeded up since last year's tournament following complaints by several Australian players. But he refused to accept that the Melbourne surface may have had a bearing on <name>Hewitt's</name> performances over the years. "<name>Lleyton's</name> proving how versatile he is on all surfaces," he said. "It is faster than last year and that'll be faster than the one <name>Lleyton</name> beat <name>Roger Federer</name> on in the Davis Cup in 2003."
