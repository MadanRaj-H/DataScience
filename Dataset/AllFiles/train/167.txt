<name>Henson</name> stakes early Lions claim

The Six Nations may be a glittering prize in itself but every player from the four Home Unions will also have one eye on a possible trip to New Zealand with the Lions this summer.

The player who staked the biggest claim for a place in the starting XV over the weekend was <name>Gavin Henson</name>. He's very confident. You just had to listen to his interview afterwards - he beamed with confidence - but although there's an element of arrogance it's good arrogance. He certainly showed some nice touches. He once showed a clean pair of heels to <name>Mathew Tait</name> when he got outside him, his defence was very good and he made some great kicks out of hand. And that's without even mentioning his majestic match-winning penalty. But I think we need to wait and see what happens because he needs to be put to the test. He needs to come up against <name>Brian O'Driscoll</name> or a big French midfield. Wales fly-half <name>Stephen Jones</name> was another player who impressed me. He gave good direction, he was very confident and he was a nice general for his side. He showed he can control a game. With <name>Jonny Wilkinson</name> not playing at the moment due to inury the number 10 shirt could be up for grabs and <name>Jones</name>, or maybe even <name>Henson</name>, could make the Lions team at fly-half.

<name>Jones</name> stuck his hand up and he certainly looks a better bet than <name>Charlie Hodgson</name> after Saturday's game. Some of the Wales forwards surprised me because I thought they would be out-muscled in the tight five. England prop <name>Julian White</name> is a capable player but when it comes down to selection <name>Gethin Jenkins</name> is now going to have the upper hand because he came out on top. However, I still think <name>White</name> and <name>Phil Vickery</name> will be in the frame. Some English players did their cause no harm. I thought <name>Joe Worsley</name> had a solid game and <name>Jason Robinson</name> and <name>Josh Lewsey</name> both did nothing wrong. But it looked too soon for young <name>Mathew Tait</name> and I think it will be a while before we see him again. Despite being written off beforehand several Scots caught my eye against France.

<name>Tom Smith</name> has been there and done it before, but the likes of <name>Chris Cusiter</name>, <name>Jason White</name> and <name>Ally Hogg</name> all made their mark. Hogg made a couple of good runs while White had a pretty robust game - his defence is right up there. <name>Cusiter</name> looked very lively and he could be a very good option for Lions coach Sir <name>Clive Woodward</name>. The star of Ireland's win over Italy in Rome looks like a certainty to make the starting XV against New Zealand. <name>Brian O'Driscoll</name> is a class act. He ran some good lines against Italy, made the breaks and fed his outside backs, although Italy defended man on man which made it easy for him. <name>Gordon D'Arcy</name> was unlucky to go off injured early on but I think you could get a <name>Henson</name>, <name>D'Arcy</name>, <name>O'Driscoll</name> combination in the Lions midfield. <name>Paul O'Connell</name> just needs to add a hard edge to his game and <name>Malcolm O'Kelly</name> keeps on going and seems to be putting his hand up, while <name>Shane Byrne</name> seems to be a lively character. But they will be a bit worried after the Italian pack drove them off their own ball on Sunday, although I used to play in Italy and I know how difficult it can be. One player who didn't impress me was Wales scrum-half <name>Dwayne Peel</name>. He choked late on in the second half when Wales were trailing. They had good possession and he kicked the ball away - I wouldn't want him as my Lions scrum-half after that.
