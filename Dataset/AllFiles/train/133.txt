<name>Williams</name> battles to Aussie title

<name>Serena Williams</name> staged a remarkable recovery to beat <name>Lindsay Davenport</name> and win her second Australian Open title.

The 2003 champion claimed her seventh Grand Slam title, and her first since Wimbledon in 2003, 2-6 6-3 6-0. Williams had looked close to quitting with a rib injury when she left the court for treatment after five games. She quickly dropped the first set but from 3-3 in the second found another gear as <name>Davenport's</name> game collapsed, allowing <name>Williams</name> to take the title. <name>Williams</name> later explained her injury problem, saying it was the result of lunging for a ball early in the first set. "<name>Lindsay</name> had me on the run out wide on my backhand and my back went but eventually I was able to come back, thank goodness," she said. <name>Davenport</name> paid tribute to <name>Williams</name>, saying: "She's had a tough couple of years and she's come back like a champion."

The 23-year-old former world number one was in desperate trouble in the early stages as the injury hampered her service action. <name>Davenport</name> took advantage to race through the opening set and held six break points in game five of the second. "I kept thinking to myself 'I'm not losing this game," said <name>Williams</name> afterwards. "'I don't care if my arm falls off, I'm not losing this game'. And I guess that's what happened. "I didn't want to lose that particular game because it would have given her a lot of momentum, and a lot of confidence." Despite letting the break points slip away <name>Davenport</name> looked comfortable enough at 3-3, but from 40-0 up she just folded. <name>Williams</name> won nine consecutive points for the set and powered through the decider as a lacklustre <name>Davenport</name> looked to have run out of energy after a gruelling two weeks. "I felt like I was playing well and in control pretty much of the match," said <name>Davenport</name>. "Then I just had that horrible lapse, I think serving up 40-0, and made a few errors and opened up the door for her and she just kept going through it. "At the end I think I was a little bit fatigued but she took advantage of it and kept going - she's a great frontrunner when she gets going."
