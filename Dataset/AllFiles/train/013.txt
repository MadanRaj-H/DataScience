Dundee Utd 4-1 Aberdeen

Dundee United eased into the semi-final of the Scottish Cup with an emphatic win over Aberdeen.

<name>Alan Archibald</name> prodded United ahead in 19 minutes and <name>James Grady</name> made it two from close range 10 minutes later. <name>Richie Byrne's</name> header gave Aberdeen a way back into the game, but <name>Stevie Crawford</name> restored United's lead from 18 yards before half time. The scoring was completed by <name>Grady</name> just after the break - a superb shot on the turn making it 4-1. <name>Tony Bullock</name> in the United goal was called into action for the first time with just over a quarter-of-an-hour on the clock. <name>Noel Whelan</name> laid the ball off to <name>Jamie Winter</name> on the edge of the box, but his first-time effort was gathered by the United keeper. Moments later though, the home side took the lead. <name>Barry Robson</name> whipped in a free kick from the right, which <name>Stevie Crawford</name> caught on the volley. <name>Russell Anderson</name> failed to deal with it and <name>Whelan's</name> clearance off the line landed kindly at the feet of <name>Archibald</name>, who poked the ball into the net. United doubled their lead after 29 minutes when <name>Grady</name> tapped the ball into an empty net after <name>Robson</name> had headed <name>Mark Wilson's</name> cross off the angle of post and bar. But only three minutes later Aberdeen clawed their way back into the match. A free kick from the left by Winter was met powerfully by the head of <name>Byrne</name> at the back post, leaving Bullock helpless.

United restored their two-goal lead four minutes before the end of a highly entertaining first half. <name>Jason Scotland</name> played a perfectly-weighted pass into the path of the onrushing <name>Crawford</name> and he coolly beat <name>Ryan Esson</name> from 18 yards. United ended the game as a contest just two minutes after the interval. <name>Grady</name> received a pass from <name>Crawford</name> with his back to goal on the edge of the box and after taking one touch, he spun to volley the ball past the despairing dive of <name>Esson</name>. The home side were in complete control and it required a good stop from <name>Esson</name> to keep out <name>Robson's</name> drive after 62 minutes. The keeper denied the same player again 10 minutes later, beating away his fierce shot from the left of the penalty area. <name>Robson</name> saw another long-range effort tipped round the post before a cute lob was headed off the line.
