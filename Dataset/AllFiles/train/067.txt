<name>Strauss</name> ton boosts England

First Test, Port Elizabeth (day two, close): South Africa 337; England 227-1

<name>Strauss</name> was 120 not out after two days in <name>Port Elizabeth</name> as England closed inexorably on the hosts' 337 all out. He put on 152 for the first wicket with <name>Marcus Trescothick</name> and added more runs with <name>Mark Butcher</name> with no England batsman prepared to miss out. Earlier, <name>Boeta Dippenaar</name> converted his overnight 79 into a century of his own. The day began with South Africa 273-7 and hoping to reach at least 350 with <name>Dippenaar</name> and <name>Thami Tsolekile</name> batting together. <name>Tsolekile</name> initially looked uncomfortable against some short-pitched <name>Andrew Flintoff</name> bowling. But <name>Steve Harmison's</name> radar was awry and though runs came slowly, there was little penetration from England's seamers.

<name>Dippenaar</name> eventually lifted the shackles by driving <name>Harmison</name> through the covers for four. An even better drive in the same area took him to 98 before he put <name>Harmison</name> high over gully for four more, reaching only his third Test century. Finally, well into the second hour, <name>Michael Vaughan</name> turned to his freshest bowler, <name>Simon Jones</name>. The Welshman struck immediately as <name>Dippenaar</name> edged into the safe hands of <name>Marcus Trescothick</name> at first slip. <name>Tsolekile</name>, having hit one excellent boundary off <name>Ashley Giles</name>, rashly attempted another soon after the loss of <name>Dippenaar</name>.

It was a big mistake, though. Slogging across the line and against the spin, he skewed the ball up into the covers for <name>Andrew Flintoff</name> to run round from slip to take the catch. <name>Giles</name> removed the last man, <name>Dale Steyn</name>, and from 324-7 South Africa had tumbled to 337 all out. <name>Strauss</name> and <name>Trescothick</name> had a potentially awkward four overs before lunch to negotiate. But having managed that, they rarely looked troubled in the second session of the day.

<name>Strauss</name>, with a series of cuts and pulls, was the more attacking partner, while <name>Trescothick</name> was seeking to play himself into some form. South Africa were severely limited by having five right-arm seamers at their disposal and no spinner and when the score rattled along to 152-0 shortly after tea they looked in deep trouble. But debutant Steyn, who had bowled a rash of no-balls in a nervous first spell, suddenly found some extra pace and a bit of reverse swing to bowl <name>Trescothick</name> for 47, the ball crashing into middle stump. <name>Shaun Pollock</name> also got the ball to reverse in the air, as the runs dried up with <name>Mark Butcher</name> trying to find his feet and <name>Strauss</name> worrying about a possible century. But once <name>Strauss</name> drove <name>Ntini</name> immaculately down the ground for four to reach three figures, <name>Butcher</name> cashed in with two crisp cover-drives of his own for boundaries off <name>Andrew Hall</name>. It was a weary South African fielding side who marched off the park at stumps.
