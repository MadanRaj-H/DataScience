<name>Kumble</name> breaks <name>Kapil's</name> record

First Test, Dhaka, day one (stumps): Bangladesh 184 all out v India

<name>Kumble</name> overtook the mark set by <name>Kapil Dev</name> when he had <name>Mohammad Rafique</name> lbw. And he followed up with a wicket next ball before Bangladesh were bowled out for 184 in 58 overs in Dhaka. After the first session was lost to rain, <name>Irfan Pathan</name> took five wickets to reduce the hosts to 106-7 before <name>Mohammad Ashraful</name> dug in. <name>Ashraful</name> ended unbeaten on 60, having hit six fours and faced 135 balls. <name>Kumble</name> had a chance of a hat-trick after removing <name>Tapash Baisya</name> via a catch at first slip but <name>Mashrafe Mortaza</name> safely defended the fifth ball of his 12th over. But a run out ended the innings not long afterwards.

India did not get chance to begin their reply as openers <name>Virender Sehwag</name> and <name>Gautam Gambhir</name> were immediately offered the light on stepping to the wicket. India won the toss and Pathan soon got stuck into the top order, dismissing <name>Javed Omar</name> lbw in his second over with one that nipped back. <name>Nafis Iqbal</name> and <name>Rajin Saleh</name> were also ajudged lbw by umpire <name>Jeremy Lloyds</name> off consecutive balls in <name>Pathan's</name> fifth over. Captain <name>Habibul Bashar</name> then pulled <name>Zaheer Khan</name> straight to square leg and when the same bowler had <name>Khaled Mashud</name> caught behind, Bangladesh were 50-5 after just 16 overs. <name>Ashraful</name>, largely in partnership with <name>Rafique</name> (47), did his best to build a recovery but India will expect to amass a huge lead on Saturday. <name>Kumble</name> is now fifth in the all-time list. Aged 34, he may still be able to reach the 500-mark, passed by only three men. Fellow leg-spinner <name>Shane Warne</name> tops the list with 552 wickets.
