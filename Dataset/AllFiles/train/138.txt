<name>Roche</name> 'turns down <name>Federer</name> offer'

Australian tennis coach <name>Tony Roche</name> has turned down an approach from <name>Roger Federer</name> to be the world number one's new full-time coach, say reports.

Melbourne's <name>Herald-Sun</name> said <name>Roche</name>, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, <name>Roche</name> is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month's defence of his Australian Open crown. <name>Federer</name> has been without a coach since splitting with <name>Peter Lundgren</name> in 2003. <name>Roche</name>, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with <name>John Newcombe</name>.

He also coached former number one <name>Ivan Lendl</name> and <name>Pat Rafter</name> to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia's <name>Lleyton Hewitt</name>. Some reports claim Federer initially wanted <name>Andre Agassi's</name> Australian coach <name>Darren Cahill</name>, before <name>Agassi</name> confirmed he would play on in 2005. <name>Federer</name> was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the BBC overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won.
