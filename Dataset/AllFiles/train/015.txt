Hearts 2-1 Livingston

Hearts wrapped up their Scottish Cup quarter-final tie against Livingston with two goals in the first 10 minutes.

<name>Lee Miller</name> scored inside the opening 60 seconds, heading over <name>Colin Meldrum</name> and into the net from a <name>Jamie McAllister</name> free kick. <name>McAllister</name> himself scored the second when he met <name>Saul Mikoliunas'</name> cross at the back post to put the game beyond the visitors. <name>Craig Easton</name> headed in a controversial goal after an hour but Hearts held on. The opening goal came after <name>Gus Bahoken</name> had clumsily fouled <name>Miller</name> 35 yards from goal. <name>McAllister</name> floated the free kick into the Livi box and <name>Miller</name> outjumped the static visiting defence to loop his header from 10 yards over Meldrum. With just 10 minutes on the clock, the home side doubled their lead. <name>Mikoliunas</name> sprinted down the right, crossed to the back post where <name>McAllister</name> raced in to head past <name>Meldrum</name>. Moments later <name>Miller</name> came close to grabbing his second with a first-time drive from 16 yards, which skimmed the bar.

Then <name>McAllister</name> picked up a pass from <name>Stephen Simmons</name> and drove an angled shot from 20 yards narrowly past <name>Meldrum's</name> far post. The impressive <name>Mikoliunas</name> twice went close before half time - a low drive was comfortably gathered by <name>Meldrum</name> and then he curled a left-footed shot past the keeper's right-hand post. Livi manager <name>Richard Gough</name> made three changes at the interval, bringing on defender <name>Goran Stanic</name>, midfielder <name>Gabor Vincze</name>, and striker <name>Ferenc Horvath</name> for <name>Bahoken</name>, <name>Derek Lilley</name> and <name>Mark Wilson</name>. But, in the opening stages of the second period, little changed. However, the West Lothian side gave themselves a lifeline with a controversial goal. <name>Eric Deloumeaux</name> sent <name>Jason Dair</name> away on the right and he tried to give the ball to <name>McPake</name>, who looked to be in an offside position. The Livi striker ignored the pass, however, and <name>Dair</name> ran on to it and played <name>Easton</name> in at the back post and he headed home from close range. The home side called for offside against <name>McPake</name> but referee <name>Alan Freeland</name> ignored their claims and pointed to the centre-circle. Livi went all out for the equaliser. In the 87th minute, <name>Burton O'Brien</name> was hauled back at the edge of the box by <name>Neil MacFarlane</name>, but <name>Dair</name> sent his shot just inches wide.
