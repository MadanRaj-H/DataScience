<name>Hewitt</name> fights back to reach final

<name>Lleyton Hewitt</name> kept his dream of an Australian Open title alive with a four-set win over <name>Andy Roddick</name> in Friday's second semi-final.

The home favourite will face <name>Marat Safin</name> in Sunday's final after coming through 3-6 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4) 6-1. <name>Hewitt</name> fought back from a set down and trailed in both tie-breaks but would not be denied, thrilling the Melbourne crowd with a typically battling effort. He is aiming to be the first Australian winner since <name>Mark Edmondson</name> in 1976. <name>Hewitt</name> is the first Australian to make the final since Pat Cash lost to <name>Mats Wilander</name> in 1988, but faces a huge challenge against <name>Safin</name> - the conqueror of <name>Roger Federer</name>. After needing five sets in his last two matches there was reason to think <name>Hewitt</name> might struggle for fitness. He certainly made a sluggish start, dropping his opening service game, and <name>Roddick</name> dominated with his huge serve as he took the first set.

After 12 tense games in the second, the key moment came when <name>Hewitt</name> raised his game in the tie-break to overturn an early mini-break. That energised the crowd but <name>Roddick</name> was not finished and raced 4-1 clear in the crucial third before <name>Hewitt</name> pegged him back and forced another tie-break. Again <name>Roddick</name> broke first and again Hewitt fought back, taking the lead with a superb backhand pass.

The Australian was not to be denied and a disheartened <name>Roddick</name> made little impact in the fourth set as <name>Hewitt</name> raced to victory, sending the Melbourne crowd wild and ensuring the final will be a huge occasion. "It's awesome," said <name>Hewitt</name>. "I started preparing for this tournament nine months ago. "I've done a lot of hard yards to get here. "I've always said I'd do anything to get in the first night final at the Australian Open. Now I've got my chance." <name>Roddick</name> was furious with himself for failing to take advantage of leads in both tie-breaks. "I'm usually pretty money in those," said <name>Roddick</name>. "Either one of those would have given me a distinct advantage. "I'm mad, I felt I was in there with a shot. He put himself in position to win big points. I donated a little more than I would have wanted." And the American played down the influence of one spectator who appeared to contribute to a double fault by shouting during <name>Rodick's</name> service action. "It just took one jackass to shout out," said <name>Roddick</name>, adding that the crowd overall was "very respectful".
