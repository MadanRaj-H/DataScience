<name>Flintoff</name> fit to bowl at Wanderers

Fourth Test, Wanderers: South Africa v England

Plays starts Thursday, 0830 GMT

There had been concerns his rib muscle injury would restrict him to playing as a specialist batsman in the match. Captain <name>Michael Vaughan</name> said: "He's had a bowl and came out fine so he is fully fit to play as an all-rounder. "We will see how he bowls. In Cape Town I thought he was our best bowler and in Durban probably our second best." <name>Flintoff</name> sent down around 20 deliveries at three-quarter pace during Wednesday's practice session. The 27-year-old incurred a side strain during the 196-run defeat in Cape Townlast week and did not bowl again until the eve of the Johannesburg Test. <name>Vaughan</name> said he would not necessarily shield <name>Flintoff</name> from bowling the same heavy workload he endured in the first three Tests. The skipper commented: "We will just have to judge who is bowling well on any given day and on the given surface to see how much we use him.

"But as a far as we're concerned he is available to play any role required." Opening batsman <name>Marcus Trescothick</name> said the team remained confident despite the defeat in Cape Town which left the series evenly poised at 1-1 with two to play. He said: "We're allowed the odd blip here and there. You don't win eight in a row without being something special. "The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off." With <name>Flintoff</name> happily fit to play and England thus likely to by unchanged, the form of pace spearhead <name>Steve Harmison</name> is the main concern. <name>Trescothick</name> said: "<name>Steve's</name> been fine throughout. [The ball's] just not been coming out so well. "Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly people come back from those. But he'll come back from that, we're just waiting for it to happen.
