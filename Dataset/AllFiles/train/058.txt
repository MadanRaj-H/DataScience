England on brink of defeat

Tour match, Potchefstroom, day three of three (rain): England 225 & 190 v South Africa A 281 & 101-3

After <name>Martin van Jaarsveld</name> was removed for a duck in the first over, <name>Andrew Puttick</name> made 45 with seven fours. But he and <name>Justin Ontong</name>, who hit four fours in 23, fell in consecutive overs after a break for lightning, and with 34 needed to win, heavy rain arrived. England were dismissed for 190, adding 36, <name>Michael Vaughan</name> ninth out after two more fours and a six en route to 100. With the home side moving serenely at 70-1, faint hopes of an escape for England arrived in the form of a violent clap of thunder, which took the players off the field. Lightning struck a field next to the ground, but there was no rain and play resumed within 10 minutes. It did have a beneficial effect for the tourists as two wickets fell within six balls.

<name>Puttick</name> was caught behind and <name>Ontong</name> hooked <name>Steve Harmison</name> to the fine-leg boundary, where <name>Ashley Giles</name> took an impressive running catch to his left. <name>Vaughan</name> began the day on 82 not out, his team 98 ahead with three wickets intact. He signalled his intentions in the very first over with a four through mid-on and a six over long-on from the spin of <name>Ontong</name>. Hopes of a long partnership with county colleague <name>Matthew Hoggard</name> were ended in the fourth over of the morning when the seamer was caught at second slip, having failed to add to his overnight three. Having pulled <name>Charl Willoughby</name> through mid-wicket for four and clipped him away to reach three figures, <name>Vaughan</name> chased a wide one from the left-armer end edged to keeper <name>Mark Boucher</name>. He spent 226 minutes at the crease and faced 151 balls.
