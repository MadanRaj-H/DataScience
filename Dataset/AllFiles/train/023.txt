<name>Sociedad</name> set to rescue <name>Mladenovic</name>

Rangers are set to loan out-of-favour midfielder  <name>Dragan Mladenovic </name> to Real Sociedad, despite the closure of the January transfer window.

 <name>Sociedad</name> have been given special permission by the Spanish FA to sign a player due to an injury crisis. <name>Mladenovic</name> will effectively replace former Rangers midfielder <name>Mikel Arteta</name>, who has been loaned to Everton. <name>Sociedad</name> say they will pay Rangers £150,000, with an option to buy the Serbia & Montenegro international. <name>Mladenovic's</name> loan move is subject to him passing a medical. The 28-year-old, who joined Rangers from Red Star Belgrade for £1.2m in the close season, is expected in San Sebastian later this week following his national side's game against Bulgaria. <name>Sociedad</name> are in 15th place in the 20-strong Primera Liga, just two points above the relegation zone. Special permission from the Spanish FA came after an injury to central defender <name>Igor Jauregi</name>. The versatile <name>Mladenovic</name> can also play in the back four. His agent said last month that Rangers had told him to find the player a new club. <name>Mladenovic's</name> time at Ibrox has been plagued with injury and he has made just six starts in six months with the Glasgow club.
