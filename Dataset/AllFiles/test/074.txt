England left in tatters in Durban

Tea, day one: England: 125-8

<name>Graham Thorpe</name> was trapped lbw, <name>Andrew Flintoff</name> looped a catch to square-leg, <name>Michael Vaughan</name> fell plumb lbw and <name>Geraint Jones</name> hooked into the deep. <name>Marcus Trescothick</name> was the first to go after England lost the toss, caught behind off <name>Makhaya Ntini</name> (3-41). <name>Mark Butcher</name> then played on and Andrew Strauss was caught at mid-off for 25.

<name>Pollock</name> is given the task of capturing the final two England wickets.

England 125-8

An authentic boundary next ball, lashed over cover for four more.

Next ball <name>Jones</name> tries to duck a bouncer and the ball barely gets above stump height, glancing the top of his head and bringing four leg byes.

<name>Jones</name> stands up to <name>Steyn</name> and pushes through the gap at mid-off for two.

<name>Boje</name> tosses one up from over the wicket and <name>Jones</name> has a dart at it, not finding the middle of the bat but smearing through a vacant mid-on for a single.

After the pace barrage, <name>Boje</name> returns and Hoggard finds a single to leave new man <name>Simon Jones</name> on strike.

The <name>Giles</name> vigil ends in disappointing fashion as, severely hampered, he hooks at <name>Steyn</name> and the man at deep square-leg does not have to move.

Favouring the back foot as <name>Steyn</name> continues to steam in, <name>Hoggard</name> is glad to see one of fullish length that he can push out for a single.

After a single is scrambled, <name>Hoggard</name> moves into the firing line and just manages to avoid a rapidly rising bouncer.

Another part of unprotected <name>Giles</name> anatomy is battered at 85mph, <name>Steyn's</name> skidding short one catching him in the armpit.

<name>Hoggard</name> jabs down at the final moment to keep out a yorker from <name>Kallis</name> that was destined for the timbers.

An appeal begun only by the keeper for caught behind against <name>Giles</name> down the legside increases a little in volume, but <name>Darrel Hair</name> is not impressed.

<name>Hoggard</name> does not know too much about a full and fast delivery, which he inside edges to fine-leg for a single.

: <name>Giles</name> hooks uncomfortably again with one hand off the bat, but the single gives him temporary reprieve from the hostile <name>Steyn</name>.

The return of <name>Kallis</name> is warmly greeted by <name>Giles</name>, who clips a loosener neatly off his pads for four.

<name>Matthew Hoggard</name> is the latest casualty, another short one from the aggressive <name>Steyn</name> thwacking into his arm guard.

The next ball is also short and <name>Giles</name> plays an unconvincing hook, with one hand coming off the bat, but some contact is made and <name>Giles</name> is grateful to stutter through for a single.

<name>Giles</name> is thumped again by another short one.

<name>Giles</name> ducks into a brutal low bouncer from <name>Steyn</name>, the ball crashes into his elbow and loops over the slip for four leg byes.

<name>Steyn</name> returns for <name>Pollock</name> as South Africa look to wrap up the innings.

The hook proves to be the undoing of <name>Jones</name>, who picks out <name>Rudolph</name> in the deep off <name>Ntini</name>.

<name>Jones</name> edges low through a gap where fourth slip would have been, bringing four urgently needed runs for England.

Another hook goes high into the space in front of square, but determined fielding from <name>Rudolph</name> restricts <name>Jones</name> to two.

Persisting with the hook shot, <name>Jones</name> is fully in control but can only get a single to deep square-leg off <name>Pollock</name>.

<name>Jones<name> hooks uppishly at <name>Ntini</name> and is within 10 yards of carrying to the fielder on the fine-leg boundary.

Aiming an expansive drive into the off-side he gets an inside edge and escapes with a single.

<name>Jone</name> pummels a cut shot off <name>Pollock</name> into the boards for his second four.

<name>Vaughan</name> is rapped on the pads bang in front by a skidding delivery from <name>Ntini</name> and umpire <name>Taufel</name> confirms his worst fears.

<name>Pollock</name> unsettles <name>Vaughan</name> with a bouncer that follows him and catches the glove.

A controlled thick edge from <name>Jones</name> finds the gap between third slip and gully and races for four.

<name>Ntini</name> returns, his first delivery down the legside and easily turned for a single by <name>Vaughan</name>.

<name>Geraint Jones</name> picks up a short one from <name>Pollock</name> and the ball soars over the ropes for the maximum to open the wicketkeeper's account in emphatic fashion.

<name>Vaughan</name> rocks back to guide a forcing shot for a much needed boundary off <name>Boje</name>.

<name>Flintoff</name> is beaten for pace by <name>Pollock</name> and his hook shot loops up tamely off the splice to square leg to leave his team in turmoil.

<name>Vaughan</name> appears to lose sight of a short one from <name>Pollock</name>, and having planned to leave it fends it awkwardly with the glove, before scrambling through for a risky single.

<name>Vaughan</name> is able to pinch a single as his gentle push on the off side defeats the fielder on the bounce.

<name>Thorpe</name> is trapped plumb in front by the metronomic <name>Pollock</name>.

<name>Boje</name> resumes after the interval, <name>Vaughan</name> crashes one into <name>Jacques Rudolph</name> at silly point but slices the next ball through gully for four.

England 58-3

<name>Vaughan</name> and <name>Thorpe</name> get through safely to lunch but know that much more will be required this afternoon.

<name>Vaughan</name>, badly needing to play a major innings, strikes a fluent boundary off <name>Boje</name>.

<name>Kallis</name> switches ends and produces a maiden as England look towards the safety of the luncheon interval.

New man <name>Graham Thorpe</name> clips a single from the final ball of the over.

The single proves effective as key man Strauss takes the strike and lofts a catch to extra cover, where <name>Ntini</name> swoops low to cap a fine morning for the home side.

<name>Boje</name> finds some early spin with his third delivery and catches the edge of <name>Vaughan's</name> bat as the England captain pushes forward, but <name>De Villiers</name> spills the chance and the ball falls to safety.

<name>Kallis</name> is replaced after two overs and the spin of <name>Nicky Boje</name> is tried 13 minutes before lunch.

There is nothing to stop a <name>Strauss</name> cut shot which brings up the England 50 in the 24th over.

<name>Strauss</name> is denied a certain boundary when his pull shot strikes square-leg umpire <name>Simon Taufel</name>.

<name>Kallis</name> escapes with a maiden as a sumptuous looking drive from <name>Vaughan</name> goes straight to the ubiquitous <name>Amla</name> in the covers.

<name>Strauss<.name> strokes the next ball gloriously down the ground for his fourth boundary.

<name>Vaughan</name> pirouettes to pull <name>Steyn</name> stylishly but only for a single as the distinctive figure of <name>Amla</name> fields on the square-leg fence.

<name>Strauss</name> eases the pressure a little by bisecting the field with a trademark drive to the boundary, as <name>Kallis</name> struggles to find his rhythm early on.

<name>Jacques Kallis</name> is introduced, having been unable to bowl in the first Test or in India, his first delivery is easily clipped into the legside for <name>Vaughan's</name> first run.

More conviction in this pull shot from <name>Strauss</name>, and <name>Steyn</name> is dispatched to the boundary.

Just a single from the over, a hook from <name>Strauss</name>, who moves to nine.

<name>Michael Vaughan</name> is given a bouncer first up and survives an optimistic shout for lbw.

An inside edge onto the stumps off <name>Steyn</name> ends <name>Butcher's</name> innings in disappointing fashion again.

A nicely timed cover drive brings Butcher three runs, with the intrepid <name>Amla</name> cutting the ball off a yard inside the ropes.

<name>Ntini</name> replaces <name>Pollock</name>, who is left to fume in the outfield, his face a light shade of crimson.

<name>Steyn</name> completes his second maiden, restricting <name>Butcher</name> with an accurate off-stump line.

<name>Pollock</name> hurls the ball back at <name>Strauss</name> and throws in a few choice words for good measure.

The extra bounce of Durban provides some uncertainty for <name>Strauss</name>, an attempted cut and hook bouncing too high for him.

<name>Dale Steyn</name> is brought into the attack and <name>Herschelle Gibbs</name> provides him with a maiden with an agile diving stop in the gully.

<name>Butcher</name> has to scamper through as he attempts a quick single to <name>Amla</name>, who is quicker than perhaps the left-hander gives him credit for, luckily for him the throw is a fraction high.

An elegant drive on the tips of his toes from <name>Strauss</name> through mid-off gives him his first boundary.

<name>Mark Butcher</name> nudges <name>Ntini</name> into the legside to open his account.

<name>Pollock</name> maintains the South Africa stranglehold with another over offering no easy runs.

A stunning one-handed catch by <name>De Villiers</name> off an inside edge ends <name>Trescothick's</name> bright innings.

<name>Strauss</name> gets down to <name>Ntini's</name> end and is happy to receive a ball on the pads which he clips neatly away through square-leg for three.

<name>Trescothick</name> slashes a wide one from <name>Ntini</name> not quite out of the middle, but there is enough on it to clear <name>Nicky Boje</name> in the gully and race for four.

<name>Strauss</name> looks for a single after driving to the right of <name>Hashim Amla</name>, but the fielder gets across well and ensures another maiden.

The wild <name>Ntini</name> produces a maiden, the final ball of the over keeping low and bouncing in front of wicketkeeper <name>AB de Villiers</name>.

<name>Strauss</name>, keen to get off the mark, attempts a drive at <name>Pollock</name> outside off-stump but misses and it is another maiden.

<name>Ntini</name> asks the question of <name>Darrell Hair</name> but <name>Trescothick</name> is a long way forward, he clips the next ball off his pads for two more.

Another probing maiden from <name>Pollock</name>, with <name>Strauss</name> content to remain on nought and leave them outside his off-stump.

<name>Trescothick</name> thumps the final ball of <name>Ntini's</name> over through the covers into the boundary boards.

<name>Pollock</name> maintains a tidy line outside off-stump to <name>Strauss</name>, who is yet to get off the mark.

<name>Trescothick</name> picks the gap at mid-off, punching <name>Ntini</name> for the day's first boundary.

<name>Ntini</name>, bowling over the wicket, angles a short ball across <name>Trescothick</name>, who does not take the bait.

<name>Pollock</name> overpitches as <name>Trescothick</name> gets the scoring under way for England with an off-drive for three runs.
