<name>Martinez</name> sees off <name>Vinci</name> challenge

Veteran <name>Spaniard Conchita Martinez</name> came from a set down to beat Italian <name>Roberta Vinci</name> at the Qatar Open in Doha.

The 1994 Wimbledon champion won 5-7 6-0 6-2 to earn a second round meeting with French Open champion <name>Anastasia Myskina</name>. Fifth seed <name>Patty Schnyder</name> also had a battle as she needed three sets to beat China's Na Li 7-5 3-6 7-5. Slovakian <name>Daniela Hantuchova</name> beat Bulgarian <name>Magdaleena Maleeva</name> 4-6 6-4 6-3 to set up a second round clash with Russian <name>Elena Bovina</name>. The veteran <name>Martinez</name> found herself in trouble early on against <name>Vinci</name> with the Italian clinching the set thanks to breaks in the third and 11th games.
