<name>Mirza</name> shocks <name>Kuznetsova</name>

<name>Sania Mirza</name> continued her remarkable rise with victory over US Open champion <name>Svetlana Kuznetsova</name> at the Dubai Championships on Tuesday.

The 18-year-old Indian, who is already a huge star in her home country, won 6-4 6-2 in front of a delirious crowd. It was <name>Mirza's</name> sixth straight victory following her first WTA tournament win in Hyderabad last month. Earlier, <name>Daniela Hantuchova</name> built on her improving form with a 7-6 6-2 win over sixth seed <name>Alicia Molik</name>. <name>Mirza</name> needed attention to an ankle injury after the second game against <name>Kuznetsova</name>.

She quickly slipped 4-0 down but staged a dramatic comeback that thrilled the large Indian contingent in the crowd. "I really didn't expect that after my ankle turn," said <name>Mirza</name>. "I played a great match and I think (the crowd) did it again. I knew that I had to play an all-round game and that's what happened. "I did everything well but I wasn't missing the ball - I don't know how that happened." <name>Mirza</name> plays <name>Silvia Farina Elia</name> or <name>Jelena Jankovic</name> next. <name>Hantuchova</name> has risen from 31 in the world at the turn of the year to number 22, having reached the quarter-finals and semi-finals at her last two events. "It was such a tough first-round match and I am glad to come through," said <name>Hantuchova</name>. "She was serving so well. I just decided to hang in there and keep fighting." The Slovakian will meet <name>Elena Likhovtseva</name> in the second round after the Russian struggled past Tunisian wild card <name>Selima Sfar</name> 2-6 6-2 7-6. <name>Likhovtseva</name> needed nine match points before seeing off <name>Sfar</name>, who got a point penalty for swearing in the third set. Seventh seed <name>Nathalie Dechy</name> and <name>Elena Bovina </name>were among other first-round winners on Tuesday.
