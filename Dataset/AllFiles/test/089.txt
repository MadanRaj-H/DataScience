<name>Murray</name> to make Cup history

<name>Andrew Murray</name> will become Britain's youngest-ever Davis Cup player after it was confirmed he will play in the doubles against Israel on Saturday.

The 17-year-old will play alongside fellow debutant <name>David Sherwood</name> against Israel's <name>Jonathan Erlich</name> and <name>Andy Ram</name>. <name>Murray</name> will eclipse the record set by <name>Roger Becker</name> back in 1952. <name>Greg Rusedski</name> takes <name>Tim Henman's</name> place as first choice in the singles, while <name>Alex Bogdanovic</name> will play in the second singles clash. <name>Rusedski</name> will take on former world number 30 <name>Harel Levy</name> and <name>Bogdanovic</name> - who has previously played in two singles rubbers against Australia - will face <name>Noam Okun</name>.

<name>Murray</name> is the brightest young hope in British tennis, after winning the US Open junior title last year and the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. British number one <name>Tim Henman</name>, who announced his Davis Cup retirement earlier this year, believes Britain can win the tie in Tel Aviv. "It's going to be as really tough match. Israel have some really good players - and their doubles pair of <name>Andy Ram</name> and <name>Jonathan Erlich</name> are among the top eight in the world - but I fancy our chances," he said. But <name>Henman</name> urged <name>Bogdanovic</name>, who has had run-ins with British tennis officials in the past, to seize his chance. "<name>Alex</name> is a quality player - he's young but he's got to keep pushing forward. "He's got to be stronger, he's got a lot of ability but he's got to be more disciplined mentally and physically and if he does that he's got a good chance."
