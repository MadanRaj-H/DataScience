Pakistan batsmen make edgy start

Tour match, Dharamsala, day one (stumps) Pakistan 165-5 v Indian Board President's XI

At stumps on day one of three, the tourists were 165-5 in Dharamsala, with only 45 overs possible because of rain. There was an important 72-run stand for the fifth wicket between <name>Inzamam-ul-Haq</name> and <name>Asim Kamal</name> after Pakistan had collapsed from 54-0 to 83-4. <name>Kamal</name> was still there at the close on 43 after captain <name>Inzamam</name>, on his 35th birthday, was dismissed for 35. Pakistan had been cruising early on through <name>Salman Butt</name> and <name>Taufeeq Umar</name> before losing four wickets for 29 runs in barely 10 overs of cricket. In the 11th over a misunderstanding with <name>Umar</name> about a second run resulted in his downfall - <name>Gagandeep Singh</name> hitting the stumps with a throw from fine leg. <name>Gagandeep/<name> then did his job with the ball as <name>Younis Khan</name> was caught at second slip for a two-ball duck. <name>Yousuf Youhana</name> batted brightly but after hitting 18 off as many deliveries he fell soon after tea inside-edging a drive off <name>Shib Paul</name> to wicket-keeper <name>Parthiv Patel</name>. And moments later Umar was held at short midwicket off bat and pad to give <name>Rudra Singh</name> a wicket. With the pressure on, <name>Inzamam</name> and <name>Kamal</name> produced a dogged effort in the final session before <name>venugopal Rao</name> trapped the skipper lbw. It was the only wicket to fall to a spinner during the course of a chilly day in this city in the foothills of the Himalayas. The match is Pakistan's only warm-up game before the first of three Tests against India begins in Mohali on 8 March.
