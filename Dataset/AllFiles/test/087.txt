<name>Henman</name> hopes ended in Dubai

Third seed <name>Tim Henman</name> slumped to a straight sets defeat in his rain-interrupted Dubai Open quarter-final against <name>Ivan Ljubicic</name>.

The Croatian eighth seed booked his place in the last four with a 7-5 6-4 victory over the British number one. <name>Henman</name> had looked on course to level the match after going 2-0 up in the second set, but his progress was halted as the rain intervened again. <name>Ljubicic</name> hit back after the break to seal a fourth straight win over <name>Henman</name>. Earlier in the day, Spanish fifth seed <name>Tommy Robredo</name> secured his semi-final place when he beat <name>Nicolas Kiefer</name> of Germany 6-4 6-4. Afterwards, <name>Henman</name> was left cursing the weather and the umpire after seven breaks for rain during the match. "It was incredibly frustrating," <name>Henman</name> said. "It's raining and the umpire doesn't take control. "He kept telling us to play till the end of the game. But if it's raining, you come off - the score's irrelevant. "It couldn't be more frustrating as I was very happy with my form until now. You don't expect this in the desert."
