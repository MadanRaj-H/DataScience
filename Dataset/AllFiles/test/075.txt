<name>Henman</name> overcomes rival <name>Rusedski</name>

<name>Tim Henman</name> saved a match point before fighting back to defeat British rival <name>Greg Rusedski</name> 4-6 7-6 (8-6) 6-4 at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday.

World number 46 <name>Rusedski</name> broke in the ninth game to take a tight opening set. <name>Rusedski</name> had match point at 6-5 in the second set tie-break after <name>Henman</name> double-faulted, but missed his chance and <name>Henman</name> rallied to clinch the set. The British number one then showed his superior strength to take the decider and earn his sixth win over <name>Rusedski</name>. Serve was held by both players with few alarms until the seventh game of the final set, when <name>Rusedski's</name> wild volley gave <name>Henman</name> a vital break. A furious <name>Rusedski</name> slammed his racket onto the ground in disgust and was warned by the umpire.

<name>Henman</name>, seeded three, then held his serve comfortably thanks to four serve-and-volley winners to take a clear 5-3 lead. <name>Rusedski</name> won his service game but <name>Henman</name> took the first of his three match points with a service winner to secure his place in the second round at Dubai for the first time in three years. It was the first match between the pair for three years - <name>Henman</name> last lost to <name>Rusedski</name> six years ago - and lasted two hours and 40 minutes. The pair are now likely to only face each other on court as rivals - rather than as team-mates - after <name>Henman</name> decided to retire from Davis Cup tennis leaving <name>Rusedski</name> to lead the team out against Israel on 4-6 March. <name>Henman</name>, who now faces Russian <name>Igor Andreev</name> in the last 16, admitted afterwards it was difficult coming up against his compatriot on a fast surface. "You just take it point by point when you're fighting to stay in the match," he said. "I had to keep playing aggressively and competing to get a chance. "I now have to recover in time for the next match because the body doesn't recover as quick as it used to, especially after two hours and 40 minutes."
