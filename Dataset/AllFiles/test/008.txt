<name>Bracewell</name> worried by <name>Lee</name>

New Zealand coach <name>John Bracewell</name> is furious that Australia paceman <name>Brett Lee</name> has bowled four beamers at his batsmen in the current one-day series.

<name>Brendon McCullum</name> was struck on the arm by a waist-high full toss in Auckland on Sunday, a match Australia won. <name>Bracewell</name> said: "He's been apologetic every time he's done it. "He was apologetic when he did it to <name>Chris Harris</name>, and <name>Paul Wiseman</name>, and he's apologised twice to <name>Brendon</name>. That's a lot of apologies."

<name>Bracewell</name> was also of the view that Lee had bowled a beamer at Pakistan's <name>Abdul Razzaq</name> during the VB Series. On Sunday, a furious <name>McCullum</name> confronted <name>Lee</name> mid-pitch after being struck on the arm, and while the incident was later resolved, <name>Bracewell</name> was not happy. <name>Lee</name>, who took 2-24 off seven overs on Saturday and also sent <name>Michael Papps</name> to hospital with a bouncer, was contrite afterwards.

He said the heavy dew caused his feet to shift on delivery stride and he lost control against <name>McCullum</name>. "Unfortunately the ball came out and it hit him - thank God it didn't hurt him," said <name>Lee</name>. "I know when I was beamed accidently by <name>Razzaq</name> [also in the VB Series] your first impression is to go crazy. "[<name>McCullum</name>] lost it there for 15-20 seconds and I went up and apologised and said 'I would never mean to do that'." Australia captain Ricky Ponting refuses to admit there is animosity between the sides despite <name>Bracewell's</name> disquiet. "Teams have got on very well," <name>Ponting</name> said. " "We've been in each other's rooms after every game. Relations have been very good. "The only thing was the full-toss that Brett bowled, otherwise everything's been great. It's been a good series played in great spirit." In the laws of the game, a bowler is removed from the attack by the umpires for bowling two beamers in a match, whether accidental or not. Any delivery that passes the batsman at or above waist-height without bouncing is deemed a no-ball.
