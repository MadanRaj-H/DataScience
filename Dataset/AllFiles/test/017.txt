<name>Jayasuriya</name> set to join Somerset

Somerset are expected to announce later on Thursday that Sri Lankan batsman <name>Sanath Jayasuriya</name> will join the county for the start of the 2005 season.

Chief executive <name>Peter Anderson</name> told BBC Sport that the club would release a statement on the matter at 1600 GMT. <name>Jayasuriya</name> will probably fill the place of <name>Graeme Smith</name> on a temporary basis as the South African is due to arrive in late May to captain the team. <name>Jayasuriya</name>, 35, had rejected an offer to play for the Scottish Saltires. <name>Jayasuriya</name> has played in 94 Tests, averaging 43.45 with the bat and taking 89 wickets with his left-arm spin. He has also played in more one-day internationals than all but three players in world cricket with 334 appearances. But the attack-minded left-hander has never played county cricket before. It is shaping up to be a golden summer for Sri Lankans in English domestic cricket, with <name>Upul Chandana<name/> (Gloucestershire), <name>Chaminda Vaas</name> (Worcestershire) and <name>Muttiah Muralitharan</name> (Lancashire) all contracted. <name>Kumar Sangakkara</name> and <name>Mahela Jayawardene</name> are also reported to be looking for opportunities.
