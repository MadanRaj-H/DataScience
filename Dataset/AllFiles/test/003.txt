South Africa far too strong again

Second one-day international, Durban South Africa 329-6 beat Zimbabwe 198-7 by 131 runs

South Africa lead three-match series 2-0

<name>Smith's</name> 117 set up the best total at Durban in 25 one-day internationals. He was given fine support by <name>Herschelle Gibbs</name> - they added 134 before <name>Justin Kemp</name> hit 53 not out off just 21 balls. Zimbabwe finished on 198-7 to lose by 131 runs with <name>Barney Rogers</name> (47) the top-scorer. South Africa lead the series 2-0 with just one to play. <name>Rogers</name> put on 71 for the first wicket with <name>Stuart Matsikenyeri</name>. But their partnership soaked up 17.3 overs - <name>Matsikenyeri</name> labouring for 79 minutes over his innings of 16 before offering a catch off the bowling of <name>Albie Morkel</name>.

The same bowler struck soon afterwards as <name>Rogers</name> clipped a fullish delivery to wide mid-on. <name>Nicky Boje</name> and <name>Adam Bacher</name> each took a brace of wickets as the middle order simply played for pride. And it was telling that <name>Bacher</name>, whose military medium pace was not even experimented with against England, finished with 2-36 off a full allotment of 10 overs. Zimbabwe had won the toss at the start of the day and did well with the ball early on, reducing the South Africans to 67-3 in the 15th over. But <name>Smith</name> and <name>Gibbs</name>, who so often form a powerful partnership in both Tests and one-day internationals, were not backwards in coming forward, launching a barrage of boundaries off the spinners. Zimbabwe were hampered when strike bowler <name>Tinashe Panyangara</name> left the field in his fourth over with a back strain.

The spinners had to do plenty of work as a result and one of them, <name>Prosper Utseya</name>, went for 60 in six overs. <name>Gibbs</name> took a particular liking to him before eventually falling to <name>Rogers</name> for 75 off 73 balls. Seam bowler <name>Christopher Mpofu</name> took 3-59 in his nine overs. He was impressive in the main but had to bowl the final over of the innings, which disappeared for 17 as <name>Justin Kemp</name> equalled the fastest half-century by a South African. He hit two fours and five towering sixes in a brutal display of hitting. Afterwards, <name>Kemp</name> said he knew nothing about the record. "I had no idea," he admitted. "I was just thinking about smashing every ball for six."
