South Africa crush Zimbabwe

First one-day international, Johannesburg: South Africa 301-7 bt Zimbabwe 136 by 165 runs

<name>Makhaya Ntini</name> and <name>Andrew Hall</name> took three wickets apiece as the tourists were bundled out for 136. <name>Adam Bacher</name> (56), <name>Graeme Smith</name> (50) and <name>Jacques Rudolph</name> (50) laid the basis for South Africa before <name>Mark Boucher</name> hit a rapid 49 in the home side's 301-7. Poor bowling allowed the hosts to add 70 in the last five overs, although spinner <name>Prosper Utseya</name> took 3-40. South Africa went into the game looking to build on their recent 4-1 win over England but were without <name>Shaun Pollock</name> (ankle), <name>Andre Nel</name> (hamstring) and <name>Jacques Kallis</name>, who was rested ahead of the Tests. Zimbabwe, who gave a debut to teenager <name>Sean Williams</name>, chose to field first after skipper <name>Tatenda Taibu</name> won the toss. But they had to wait 16 overs for their first success as <name>Smith</name> and <name>Bacher</name> put on 87 for the first wicket. The breakthrough came when <name>Smith</name> was trapped lbw after missing a full toss from <name>Stuart Matsikenyeri</name> as he tried to swing the ball away to leg. <name>Bacher's</name> fifty took 65 balls but he only faced eight more before holing out to <name>Hamilton Masakadza</name> off <name>Utseya</name>. <name>Rudolph</name> and <name>Herschelle Gibbs</name> put on 56 for the third wicket, but runs did not come freely as the spinners found purchase on a cracked surface. <name>Utseya</name> accounted for <name>Rudolph</name> in the 37th over and <name>Justin Kemp</name> quickly came and went after being easily stumped by <name>Taibu</name>. <name>Gibbs</name> was caught off <name>Barney Rogers</name> for 40 but <name>Boucher</name> punished the inexperienced Zimbabwe attack before being denied a half century by <name>Elton Chigumbura</name>. <name>Albie Morkel</name> then weighed in with 16 off six deliveries as the innings drew to a close. In reply, the Zimbabweans were rocked by a burst from new-ball pair <name>Ntini</name> and <name>Hall</name>, who reduced them to 55-4. It got worse when <name>Morkel</name> claimed two wickets in an over - and the match was effectively over.
